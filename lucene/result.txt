And it can be a very complicated thing , what human health is .
And bringing those two together might seem a very da@@ unting task , but what I &apos;m going to try to say is that even in that complexity , there &apos;s some simple themes that I think , if we understand , we can really move forward .
And those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
And I &apos;m going to start with this one : If m@@ omm@@ a ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
We know that , right ? We &apos;ve experienced that .
And if we just take that and we build from there , then we can go to the next step , which is that if the ocean ain &apos;t happy , ain &apos;t nobody happy .
That &apos;s the theme of my talk .
And we &apos;re making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways .
This is a shot of Cann@@ ery R@@ ow in 19@@ 32 .
Cann@@ ery R@@ ow , at the time , had the biggest industrial c@@ anning operation on the west coast .
We p@@ iled enormous amounts of pollution into the air and into the water .
R@@ olf Bol@@ in , who was a professor at the Hop@@ kin &apos;s Marine Station where I work , wrote in the 19@@ 40@@ s that &quot; The f@@ umes from the sc@@ um floating on the in@@ lets of the bay were so bad they turned le@@ ad@@ @@ based pain@@ ts black . &quot;
People working in these cann@@ eries could barely stay there all day because of the smell , but you know what they came out saying ?
They say , &quot; You know what you smell ?
You smell money . &quot;
That pollution was money to that community , and those people dealt with the pollution and absor@@ bed it into their skin and into their bodies because they needed the money .
We made the ocean unhappy ; we made people very unhappy , and we made them un@@ healthy .
The connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple ad@@ ages , and I want to call that &quot; pin@@ ch a min@@ now , hurt a whale . &quot;
The py@@ ra@@ mid of ocean life ...
Now , when an ec@@ ologist looks at the ocean  I have to tell you  we look at the ocean in a very different way , and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean because when an ec@@ ologist looks at the ocean , we see all those inter@@ connections .
We see the base of the food chain , the plan@@ k@@ ton , the small things , and we see how those animals are food to animals in the middle of the py@@ ra@@ mid , and on so up this di@@ agram .
And that flow , that flow of life , from the very base up to the very top , is the flow that ec@@ ologists see .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; Save the ocean . He@@ al the ocean . &quot;
It &apos;s that py@@ ra@@ mid .
Now why does that matter for human health ?
Because when we jam things in the bottom of that py@@ ra@@ mid that shouldn &apos;t be there , some very fri@@ ghtening things happen .
Poll@@ ut@@ ants , some poll@@ ut@@ ants have been created by us : molec@@ ules like PC@@ Bs that can &apos;t be broken down by our bodies .
And they go in the base of that py@@ ra@@ mid , and they dri@@ ft up ; they &apos;re passed up that way , on to pre@@ dat@@ ors and on to the top pre@@ dat@@ ors , and in so doing , they accum@@ ulate .
Now , to bring that home , I thought I &apos;d inv@@ ent a little game .
We don &apos;t really have to play it ; we can just think about it here .
It &apos;s the Sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am and chocolate game .
Imagine that when we got on this boat , we were all given two Sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pean@@ uts .
Can &apos;t do much with them : Put them in your pocket .
Suppose the rules are : every time you offer somebody a drink , you give them the drink , and you give them your Sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pean@@ uts too .
What &apos;ll happen is that the Sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pean@@ uts will start moving through our society here , and they will accum@@ ulate in the dr@@ unk@@ est , stin@@ gi@@ est people .
There &apos;s no mechanism in this game for them to go anywhere but into a bigger and bigger pile of indi@@ ges@@ tible Sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pean@@ uts .
And that &apos;s exactly what happens with PD@@ Bs in this food py@@ ra@@ mid : They accum@@ ulate into the top of it .
Now suppose , instead of Sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am pean@@ uts , we take these lovely little chocol@@ ates that we get and we had those instead .
Well , some of us would be eating those chocol@@ ates instead of passing them around , and instead of accum@@ ulating , they will just pass into our group here and not accum@@ ulate in any one group because they &apos;re absor@@ bed by us .
And that &apos;s the difference between a PC@@ B and , say , something natural like an ome@@ ga@@ @@ 3 , something we want out of the marine food chain .
PC@@ Bs accum@@ ulate .
We have great examples of that , unfortunately .
PC@@ Bs accum@@ ulate in dol@@ phin@@ s in Sar@@ as@@ ota Bay , in Texas , in North Carolina .
They get into the food chain .
The dol@@ phin@@ s eat the fish that have PC@@ Bs from the plan@@ k@@ ton , and those PC@@ Bs , being fat@@ @@ sol@@ u@@ ble , accum@@ ulate in these dol@@ phin@@ s .
Now , a dol@@ phin , mother dol@@ phin , any dol@@ phin  there &apos;s only one way that a PC@@ B can get out of a dol@@ phin .
And what &apos;s that ?
In mother &apos;s milk .
Here &apos;s a di@@ agram of the PC@@ B load of dol@@ phin@@ s in Sar@@ as@@ ota Bay .
Ad@@ ult males : a huge load .
Ju@@ ven@@ iles : a huge load .
F@@ em@@ ales after their first cal@@ f is already we@@ an@@ ed : a lower load .
Those fem@@ ales , they &apos;re not trying to .
Those fem@@ ales are passing the PC@@ Bs in the fat of their own mother &apos;s milk into their off@@ spring , and their off@@ spring don &apos;t survive .
The death rate in these dol@@ phin@@ s , for the first cal@@ f born of every female dol@@ phin , is 60 to 80 percent .
These mothers pump their first off@@ spring full of this poll@@ ut@@ ant , and most of them die .
Now , the mother then can go and re@@ produce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accum@@ ulation of this poll@@ ut@@ ant in these animals  the death of the fir@@ st@@ @@ born cal@@ f .
There &apos;s another top pre@@ dat@@ or in the ocean , it turns out .
That top pre@@ dat@@ or , of course , is us .
And we also are eating meat that comes from some of these same places .
This is whale meat that I photograph@@ ed in a gro@@ cery store in Tokyo  or is it ?
In fact , what we did a few years ago was learn how to smu@@ ggle a molec@@ ular biology lab into Tokyo and use it to genetically test the DNA out of whale meat samples and identify what they really were .
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat .
Some of them were illegal whale meat , by the way .
That &apos;s another story .
But some of them were not whale meat at all .
Even though they were lab@@ eled whale meat , they were dol@@ phin meat .
Some of them were dol@@ phin liver . Some of them were dol@@ phin blu@@ b@@ ber .
And those dol@@ phin parts had a huge load of PC@@ Bs , diox@@ ins and heavy metals .
And that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
It turns out that a lot of dol@@ phin@@ s are being sold as meat in the whale meat market around the world .
That &apos;s a tragedy for those populations , but it &apos;s also a tragedy for the people eating them because they don &apos;t know that that &apos;s toxic meat .
We had these data a few years ago .
I remember sitting at my desk being about the only person in the world who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets was really dol@@ phin meat , and it was toxic .
It had two@@ @@ to@@ @@ thre@@ e@@ to@@ @@ 400 times the toxic loads ever allowed by the EPA .
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking , &quot; Well , I know this . This is a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
And for the very first time in my scientific career , I broke scientific protocol , which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journ@@ als and then begin to talk about them .
We sent a very polite letter to the Minister of Health in Japan and simply pointed out that this is an intoler@@ able situation , not for us , but for the people of Japan because mothers who may be bre@@ ast@@ feeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan , and I &apos;m really proud to say that at this point , it &apos;s very difficult to buy anything in Japan that &apos;s lab@@ eled in@@ correctly , even though they &apos;re still selling whale meat , which I believe they shouldn &apos;t .
But at least it &apos;s lab@@ eled correctly , and you &apos;re no longer going to be buying toxic dol@@ phin meat instead .
It isn &apos;t just there that this happens , but in a natural diet of some communities in the Canadian arc@@ tic and in the United States and in the European arc@@ tic , a natural diet of se@@ als and wh@@ ales leads to an accum@@ ulation of PC@@ Bs that have gathered up from all parts of the world and ended up in these women .
These women have toxic breast milk .
They cannot feed their off@@ spring , their children , their breast milk because of the accum@@ ulation of these tox@@ ins in their food chain , in their part of the world &apos;s ocean py@@ ra@@ mid .
That means their immune systems are compromised .
It means that their children &apos;s development can be compromised .
And the world &apos;s attention on this over the last decade has reduced the problem for these women , not by changing the py@@ ra@@ mid , but by changing what they particularly eat out of it .
We &apos;ve taken them out of their natural py@@ ra@@ mid in order to solve this problem .
That &apos;s a good thing for this particular acute problem , but it does nothing to solve the py@@ ra@@ mid problem .
There &apos;s other ways of breaking the py@@ ra@@ mid .
The py@@ ra@@ mid , if we jam things in the bottom , can get backed up like a se@@ wer line that &apos;s clo@@ gged .
And if we jam nutri@@ ents , se@@ wage , fertili@@ zer in the base of that food py@@ ra@@ mid , it can back up all through it .
We end up with things we &apos;ve heard about before : red ti@@ des , for example , which are blo@@ oms of toxic al@@ ga@@ e floating through the oc@@ eans causing neuro@@ logical damage .
We can also see blo@@ oms of bacteria , blo@@ oms of viruses in the ocean .
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here and a bacteria in the gen@@ us vi@@ bri@@ o , which includes the gen@@ us that has ch@@ oler@@ a in it .
How many people have seen a &quot; beach closed &quot; sign ?
Why does that happen ?
It happens because we have jam@@ med so much into the base of the natural ocean py@@ ra@@ mid that these bacteria clo@@ g it up and over@@ fill onto our beaches .
O@@ ften what j@@ ams us up is se@@ wage .
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; C@@ losed because human se@@ wage is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
Not very often . We wouldn &apos;t tolerate that .

We wouldn &apos;t tolerate our parks being sw@@ amp@@ ed by human se@@ wage , but beaches are closed a lot in our country .
They &apos;re closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason , and I believe we shouldn &apos;t tolerate that either .
It &apos;s not just a question of clean@@ liness ; it &apos;s also a question of how those organisms then turn into human disease .
These vi@@ bri@@ os , these bacteria , can actually inf@@ ect people .
They can go into your skin and create skin inf@@ ections .
This is a graph from NO@@ AA &apos;s ocean and human health initiative , showing the rise of the inf@@ ections by vi@@ bri@@ o in people over the last few years .
Sur@@ fers , for example , know this incredibly .
And if you can see on some surfing sites , in fact , not only do you see what the waves are like or what the weather &apos;s like , but on some surf rider sites , you see a little flas@@ hing po@@ o alert .
That means that the beach might have great waves , but it &apos;s a dangerous place for sur@@ fers to be because they can carry with them , even after a great day of surfing , this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve .
Some of these inf@@ ections are actually carrying antibio@@ tic resistance genes now , and that makes them even more difficult .
These same inf@@ ections create harmful al@@ gal blo@@ oms .
Those blo@@ oms are generating other kinds of chemicals .
This is just a simple list of some of the types of pois@@ ons that come out of these harmful al@@ gal blo@@ oms : sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning , fish ci@@ gu@@ ater@@ a , di@@ arr@@ hei@@ c sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning  you don &apos;t want to know about that  neuro@@ toxic sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning , paraly@@ tic sh@@ ell@@ fish pois@@ oning .
These are things that are getting into our food chain because of these blo@@ oms .
Rita Cal@@ well very fam@@ ously traced a very interesting story of ch@@ oler@@ a into human communities , brought there , not by a normal human v@@ ector , but by a marine v@@ ector , this cop@@ e@@ pod .
Cop@@ e@@ po@@ ds are small cru@@ stac@@ eans .
They &apos;re a tiny fra@@ ction of an inch long , and they can carry on their little legs some of the ch@@ oler@@ a bacteria that then leads to human disease .
That has spar@@ ked ch@@ oler@@ a epide@@ m@@ ics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these v@@ ec@@ tors of ch@@ oler@@ a around the world .
So what do you do ?
We have major problems in disrup@@ ted eco@@ system flow that the py@@ ra@@ mid may not be working so well , that the flow from the base up into it is being blocked and clo@@ gged .
What do you do when you have this sort of disrup@@ ted flow ?
Well , there &apos;s a bunch of things you could do .
You could call Joe the Pl@@ um@@ ber , for example .
And he could come in and fix the flow .
But in fact , if you look around the world , not only are there hope spots for where we may be able to fix problems , there have been places where problems have been fixed , where people have come to gri@@ ps with these issues and begun to turn them around .
Monter@@ ey is one of those .
I started out showing how much we had dist@@ ressed the Monter@@ ey Bay eco@@ system with pollution and the c@@ anning industry and all of the att@@ endant problems .
In 19@@ 32 , that &apos;s the picture .
In 2009 , the picture is dramatically different .
The cann@@ eries are gone . The pollution has ab@@ ated .
But there &apos;s a greater sense here that what the individual communities need is working eco@@ systems .
They need a functioning py@@ ra@@ mid from the base all the way to the top .
And that py@@ ra@@ mid in Monter@@ ey , right now , because of the efforts of a lot of different people , is functioning better than it &apos;s ever func@@ tioned for the last 150 years .
It didn &apos;t happen accidentally .
It happened because many people put their time and effort and their pion@@ eering spirit into this .
On the left there , Julia Pl@@ att , the mayor of my little hom@@ et@@ own in Pacific Gro@@ ve .
At 74 years old , became mayor because something had to be done to protect the ocean .
In 19@@ 31 , she produced California &apos;s first commun@@ ity@@ @@ based marine protected area , right next to the biggest poll@@ uting cann@@ ery , because Julia knew that when the cann@@ eries eventually were gone , the ocean needed a place to grow from , that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed , and she wanted to provide that seed .
Other people , like David Pack@@ ard and Julie Pack@@ ard , who were instru@@ mental in producing the Monter@@ ey Bay aqu@@ arium to lock into people &apos;s notion that the ocean and the health of the ocean eco@@ system were just as important to the economy of this area as eating the eco@@ system would be .
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortun@@ es of Monter@@ ey Bay , but other places around the world .
Well , I want to leave you with the thought that what we &apos;re really trying to do here is protect this ocean py@@ ra@@ mid , and that ocean py@@ ra@@ mid connects to our own py@@ ra@@ mid of life .
It &apos;s an ocean planet , and we think of ourselves as a ter@@ restri@@ al species , but the py@@ ra@@ mid of life in the ocean and our own lives on land are intri@@ c@@ ately connected .
And it &apos;s only through having the ocean being healthy that we can remain healthy ourselves .
Thank you very much .
Stephen Pal@@ um@@ bi : Following the mercury trail
There &apos;s a tight and surprising link between the ocean &apos;s health and ours , says marine bi@@ ologist Stephen Pal@@ um@@ bi . He shows how tox@@ ins at the bottom of the ocean food chain find their way into our bodies , with a shocking story of toxic contamination from a Japanese fish market . His work points a way forward for saving the oc@@ eans &apos; health  and humanity &apos;s .
Adrian Koh@@ ler : Well , we &apos;re here today to talk about the evolution of a pupp@@ et horse .
Bas@@ il Jones : But actually we &apos;re going to start this evolution with a hy@@ ena .
A@@ K : The anc@@ est@@ or of the horse .
Okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Ha@@ ha@@ ha@@ ha .
The hy@@ ena is the anc@@ est@@ or of the horse because it was part of a production called &quot; Fau@@ st@@ us in Africa , &quot; a Hand@@ spring Production from 1995 , where it had to play drau@@ ghts with Helen of Troy .
This production was directed by South African artist and theater director , William K@@ ent@@ ridge .
So it needed a very artic@@ ulate front pa@@ w .
But , like all pupp@@ ets , it has other at@@ tributes .
B@@ J : One of them is breath , and it kind of breath@@ es .
A@@ K : Ha@@ a ha@@ a ha@@ a@@ a .
B@@ J : Bre@@ ath is really important for us .
It &apos;s the kind of original movement for any pupp@@ et for us on@@ stage .
It &apos;s the thing that distingu@@ ishes the pupp@@ et  A@@ K : O@@ ops .
B@@ J : From an actor .
Pu@@ pp@@ ets always have to try to be alive .
It &apos;s their kind of ur@@ @@ story on@@ stage , that desper@@ ation to live .
A@@ K : Yeah , it &apos;s basically a dead object , as you can see , and it only lives because you make it .
An actor stru@@ ggles to die on@@ stage , but a pupp@@ et has to struggle to live .
And in a way that &apos;s a metap@@ hor for life .
B@@ J : So every moment it &apos;s on the stage , it &apos;s making the struggle .
So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up@@ @@ to@@ @@ the@@ @@ minute 17th century technology  to turn no@@ uns into verb@@ s .
A@@ K : Well actually I prefer to say that it &apos;s an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life .
B@@ J : Okay so .
A@@ K : It has ears that move pas@@ sively when the head goes .
B@@ J : And it has these bul@@ k@@ heads made out of pl@@ ywood , covered with fabric  curi@@ ously similar , in fact , to the pl@@ ywood can@@ oes that Adrian &apos;s father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop .
A@@ K : In Port Elizabeth , the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa .
B@@ J : His mother was a pupp@@ et@@ eer .
And when we met at art school and fell in love in 1971 , I hated pupp@@ ets .
I really thought they were so beneath me .
I wanted to become an av@@ ant@@ @@ garde artist  and P@@ unch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go .
And , in fact , it took about 10 years to discover the Bam@@ bar@@ a Bam@@ ana pupp@@ ets of Mal@@ i in West Africa , where there &apos;s a fabulous tradition of pupp@@ etry , to learn a renewed , or a new , respect for this art form .
A@@ K : So in 1981 , I persu@@ aded Bas@@ il and some friends of mine to form a pupp@@ et company .
And 20 years later , mi@@ ra@@ cul@@ ously , we collabor@@ ated with a company from Mal@@ i , the So@@ gol@@ on Mari@@ on@@ ette T@@ rou@@ pe of Bam@@ ako , where we made a piece about a tall gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
It was just called &quot; T@@ all Horse , &quot; which was a life@@ @@ sized gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
B@@ J : And here again , you see the same structure .
The bul@@ k@@ heads have now turned into ho@@ ops of cane , but it &apos;s ultimately the same structure .
It &apos;s got two people inside it on stil@@ ts , which give them the height , and somebody in the front who &apos;s using a kind of steering wheel to move that head .
A@@ K : The person in the h@@ ind legs is also controlling the tail , a bit like the hy@@ ena  same mechanism , just a bit bigger .
And he &apos;s controlling the ear movement .
B@@ J : So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London .
And just around that time , his mother had said , &quot; Have you seen this book by Michael Mor@@ pur@@ go called &apos; War Horse &apos; ? &quot;
A@@ K : It &apos;s about a boy who falls in love with a horse .
The horse is sold to the First World War , and he jo@@ ins up to find his horse .
B@@ J : So Tom gave us a call and said , &quot; Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre ? &quot;
A@@ K : It seemed a lovely idea .
B@@ J : But it had to ride . It had to have a rider .
A@@ K : It had to have a rider , and it had to participate in cav@@ al@@ ry charges .
A play about early 20th century plo@@ wing technology and cav@@ al@@ ry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London .
But they agreed to go along with it for a while .
So we began with a test .
B@@ J : This is Adrian and Th@@ ys St@@ ander , who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse , and our nex@@ t@@ door neighbor Katherine , riding on a ladder .
The weight is really difficult when it &apos;s up above your head .
A@@ K : And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell , we knew that we might be able to make a horse , which could be ri@@ dden .
have proceeded 200 lines.

So we made a model .
This is a card@@ board model , a little bit smaller than the hy@@ ena .
You &apos;ll notice that the legs are pl@@ ywood legs and the can@@ oe structure is still there .
B@@ J : And the two manipul@@ ators are inside .
But we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t manipul@@ ate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
A@@ K : We started work on the prototype after the model was approved , and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated .
We had to throw out the pl@@ ywood legs and make new cane ones .
And we had a c@@ rate built for it .
It had to be shipped to London .
We were going to test@@ @@ drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town , and it got to midnight and we hadn &apos;t done that yet .
B@@ J : So we got a camera , and we posed the pupp@@ et in various g@@ allo@@ ping stances .
And we sent it off to the National Theatre , hoping that they believed that we created something that worked .
A@@ K : A month later , we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us .
B@@ J : About 40 people .
A@@ K : We were terrified .
We opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ri@@ dden .
Here I have an 18@@ @@ second clip of the very first walk of the prototype .
This is in the National Theatre studio , the place where they cook new ideas .
It had by no means got the green light yet .
The ch@@ ore@@ ogra@@ pher , Toby Se@@ d@@ g@@ wick , invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse , which was made out of sticks and bits of t@@ wi@@ gs , grew up into the big horse .
And Nick Star@@ r , the director of the National Theatre , saw that particular moment , he was standing next to me  he nearly wet himself .
And so the show was given the green light .
And we went back to Cape Town and re@@ designed the horse completely .
Here is the plan .
And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses .
You can see quite a lot of skel@@ et@@ ons in the background there .
The horses are completely hand@@ made .
There is very little 20th century technology in them .
We used a bit of laser cutting on the pl@@ ywood and some of the al@@ umin@@ um pieces .
But because they have to be light and flexible , and each one of them is different , they can &apos;t be mass@@ @@ produced , unfortunately .
So here are some half@@ @@ finished horses ready to be worked in London .
And now we would like to introduce you to Joey .
Joey boy , you there ?
Joey .
Joey .
Joey , come here .
No , no , I haven &apos;t got it .
He &apos;s got it ; it &apos;s in his pocket .
B@@ J : Joey .
A@@ K : Joey , Joey , Joey , Joey .
Come here . Stand here where people can see you .
Move around . Come on .
I &apos;d just like to describe  I won &apos;t talk too loud . He might get irrit@@ ated .
Here , Craig is working the head .
He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand .
Each one of them operates either an ear , separately , or the head , up and down .
But he also controls the head directly by using his hand .
The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse .
When they point right back , the horse is fear@@ ful or angry , depending upon what &apos;s going on in front of him , around him .
Or , when he &apos;s more relaxed , the head comes down and the ears listen , either side .
Hor@@ ses &apos; hearing is very important .
It &apos;s almost more important than their ey@@ esi@@ ght .
Over here , Tommy &apos;s got what you call the heart position .
He &apos;s working the leg .
You see the string ten@@ don from the hy@@ ena , the hy@@ ena &apos;s front leg , automatically pul@@ ls the hoo@@ p up .
Hor@@ ses are so un@@ predictable .
The way a ho@@ of comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convincing horse action .
The h@@ ind legs have got the same action .
B@@ J : And Mikey also has , in his fingers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
And together , there &apos;s quite a complex possibility of tail expression .
A@@ K : You want to say something about the breathing ?
B@@ J : We had a big challenge with breathing .
Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the pupp@@ et in two and make it breathe like that  because that &apos;s how a horse would breathe , with an expanded chest .
But we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn &apos;t , as an audience , see the breath .
So he made a channel in here , and the chest moves up and down in that channel .
So it &apos;s anti@@ natur@@ alistic really , the up and down movement , but it feels like breath .
And it &apos;s very , very simple because all that happens is that the pupp@@ et@@ eer breath@@ es with his knees .
A@@ K : Other emotional stuff .
If I were to touch the horse here on his skin , the heart pupp@@ et@@ eer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to qui@@ ver .
You &apos;ll notice , of course , that the pupp@@ et is made out of cane lines .
And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice , that I was making a thre@@ e@@ dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space .
But of course , it was the cane is light , and the cane is mol@@ d@@ able .
And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane .
The skin itself is made out of a see@@ @@ through n@@ ylon mes@@ h , which , if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear , she can light the background and the horse becomes gho@@ st@@ like .
You see the skel@@ etal structure of it .
Or if you light it from above , it becomes more solid .
Again , that was a practical consideration .
The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out .
They have to be able to act And it &apos;s very much an in@@ @@ the@@ @@ moment activity that they &apos;re engaged in .
It &apos;s three heads making one character .
But now we would like you to put Joey through some pac@@ es .
And plant .
Thank you .
And now just  All the way from sunny California we have Z@@ em Jo@@ aqu@@ in who &apos;s going to ride the horse for us .
So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly .
B@@ J : Not being able to talk to one another while they &apos;re on@@ stage because they &apos;re mic &apos;d .
The sound that that very large chest makes , of the horse  the wh@@ inn@@ ying and the nick@@ ering and everything  that starts usually with one per@@ former , carries on with a second person and ends with a third .
A@@ K : Mikey Brett from Lei@@ c@@ ester@@ shire .
Mikey Brett , Craig , Leo , Z@@ em Jo@@ aqu@@ in and Bas@@ il and me .
Thank you . Thank you .
Hand@@ spring Pu@@ pp@@ et Co . : The genius pupp@@ etry behind War Horse
&quot; Pu@@ pp@@ ets always have to try to be alive , &quot; says Adrian Koh@@ ler of the Hand@@ spring Pu@@ pp@@ et Company , a glori@@ ously ambitious trou@@ pe of human and wooden actors . Beg@@ inning with the tale of a hy@@ ena &apos;s subtle pa@@ w , pupp@@ et@@ eers Koh@@ ler and Bas@@ il Jones build to the story of their latest aston@@ ishment : the wonder@@ fully life@@ @@ like Joey , the War Horse , who tro@@ ts convin@@ c@@ ingly onto the stage .
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clo@@ cks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
These are chemical clo@@ cks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
I &apos;ll give you an example  if you take a hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e cra@@ b off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a slo@@ ped cage , it will scra@@ m@@ ble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it &apos;ll sk@@ itter down again right as the water is rec@@ eding thousands of miles away .
It &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
And it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or par@@ an@@ or@@ mal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these cra@@ bs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
So , we have this ability as well .

And in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
People actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of ra@@ ving about their productive time in the hole .
So , no matter how at@@ yp@@ ical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
They get up just a little bit later every day  say 15 minutes or so  and they kind of dri@@ ft all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
And so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clo@@ cks , rather than somehow sen@@ sing the day outside .
So fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
It &apos;s a huge driver for culture and I think that it &apos;s the most under@@ rated force on our behavior .
We evolved as a species near the equ@@ ator , and so we &apos;re very well@@ @@ equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
But of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada , where I live , we have perpet@@ ual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
So the culture , the northern ab@@ original culture , traditionally has been highly seas@@ onal .
In winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
And in summer , it &apos;s almost man@@ ic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
So , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ?
Well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
They go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m .
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sun@@ rise .
And in@@ @@ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of medi@@ t@@ ative quiet in bed .
And during this time , there &apos;s a sur@@ ge of pro@@ lac@@ tin , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the day@@ time , that they realize they &apos;re experiencing true wa@@ ke@@ ful@@ ness for the first time in their lives .
So , cut to the modern day .
We &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24@@ @@ hour business , shift work .
And you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but I believe we should understand the costs .
Thank you .
J@@ essa Gam@@ ble : Our natural sleep cycle
In today &apos;s world , balan@@ cing school , work , kids and more , most of us can only hope for the recommended eight hours of sleep . Ex@@ am@@ ining the science behind our body &apos;s internal clock , J@@ essa Gam@@ ble reveals the surprising and substantial program of rest we should be ob@@ serving .
I want to help you re@@ perc@@ eive what ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is , what it could be , and what your relationship to it is .
And in doing that , I want to offer you a vision , an imagined future , if you will , of how , as the poet Se@@ am@@ us He@@ an@@ ey has put it , &quot; Once in a lifetime the lon@@ ge@@ d@@ for ti@@ dal wave of justice can rise up , and hope and history r@@ hy@@ me . &quot;
I want to start with these word pairs here .
We all know which side of these we &apos;d like to be on .
When ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y was re@@ invented a century ago , when the foundation form was actually invented , they didn &apos;t think of themselves on the wrong side of these either .
In fact they would never have thought of themselves as closed and set in their ways , as slow to respond to new challenges , as small and risk@@ @@ a@@ verse .
And in fact they weren &apos;t . They were re@@ inv@@ enting charity in those times , what Rock@@ ef@@ eller called &quot; the business of bene@@ vol@@ ence . &quot;
But by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of cri@@ tics and reform@@ ers had come to see ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y just this way .
The thing to watch for as a global ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y industry comes about  and that &apos;s exactly what is happening  is how the aspi@@ ration is to flip these old assu@@ mp@@ tions , for ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
This entrepreneur@@ ial energy is emerging from many quarters .
And it &apos;s driven and prop@@ elled forward by new leaders , like many of the people here , by new tools , like the ones we &apos;ve seen here , and by new pressures .
I &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
This report is our main public report .
What it tells is the story of how today actually could be as historic as 100 years ago .
What I want to do is share some of the cool@@ est things that are going on with you .
And as I do that , I &apos;m not going to dwell much on the very large ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y that everybody already knows about  the Gates or the Sor@@ os or the Google .
Instead , what I want to do is talk about the ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y of all of us : the democra@@ tiz@@ ation of ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
This is a moment in history when the average person has more power than at any time .
What I &apos;m going to do is look at five categories of experiments , each of which challenges an old assumption of ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
The first is mass collaboration , represented here by Wiki@@ pedia .
Now , this may surprise you .
But remember , ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is about giving of time and talent , not just money .
Clay Shir@@ ky , that great chron@@ ic@@ ler of everything net@@ worked , has captured the assumption that this challenges in such a beautiful way .
He said , &quot; We have lived in this world where little things are done for love and big things for money .
Now we have Wiki@@ pedia .
Suddenly big things can be done for love . &quot;
Watch , this spring , for Paul Haw@@ ken &apos;s new book  Auth@@ or and entreprene@@ ur many of you may know about .
The book is called &quot; Bl@@ essed Un@@ rest . &quot;
And when it comes out , a series of wi@@ ki sites under the label W@@ IS@@ ER , are going to launch at the same time .
W@@ IS@@ ER stands for World Index for Social and Environmental Respon@@ sibility .
W@@ IS@@ ER sets out to document , link and em@@ power what Paul calls the largest movement , and fa@@ st@@ est@@ @@ growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective immune response to today &apos;s threats .
Now , all of these big things for love  experiments  aren &apos;t going to take off .
But the ones that do are going to be the biggest , the most open , the fastest , the most connected form of ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y in human history .
Second category is online ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y market@@ places .
This is , of course , to ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y what eBay and Amazon are to commerce .
Think of it as pe@@ er@@ @@ to@@ @@ pe@@ er ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
And this challenges yet another assumption , which is that organized ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is only for the very wealthy .
Take a look , if you haven &apos;t , at Don@@ or@@ s@@ Choose .
O@@ mi@@ dy@@ ar Network has made a big investment in Don@@ or@@ s@@ Choose .
It &apos;s one of the best known of these new market@@ places where a donor can go straight into a class@@ room and connect with what a teacher says they need .
Take a look at Chan@@ ging the Pres@@ ent , started by a T@@ ED@@ ster , next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present .
Gi@@ ve@@ India is for a whole country .
And it goes on and on .
The third category is represented by Warren Buffet , which I call ag@@ greg@@ ated giving .
It &apos;s not just that Warren Buffet was so amaz@@ ingly generous in that historic act last summer .
It &apos;s that he challenged another assumption , that every gi@@ ver should have his or her own fund or foundation .
There are now , today , so many new funds that are ag@@ greg@@ ating giving and investing , bringing together people around a common goal , to think bigger .
One of the best known is Ac@@ umen Fund , led by Jacqu@@ eline No@@ vo@@ gr@@ atz , a T@@ ED@@ ster who got a big boost here at TED .
But there are many others : New Profit in Cambridge , New School &apos;s Vent@@ ure Fund in Sili@@ con Valley , Vent@@ ure Phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y Partners in Washington , Global Fund for Women in San Francisco .
Take a look at these .
These funds are to ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y what venture capital , private equity , and eventually mutual funds are to investing , but with a twist  because often a community forms around these funds , as it has at Ac@@ umen and other places .
Now , imagine for a second these first three types of experiments : mass collaboration , online market@@ places , ag@@ greg@@ ated giving .
And understand how they help us re@@ perc@@ eive what organized ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is .
It &apos;s not about foundations necessarily ; it &apos;s about the rest of us .
And imagine the mas@@ h@@ up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future  imagine that somebody puts up , say , 100 million dollars for an inspir@@ ing goal  there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year , not out of the question  but only puts it up if it &apos;s matched by millions of small gifts from around the globe , thereby eng@@ aging lots of people , and building visibility and eng@@ aging people in the goal that &apos;s stated .
I &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories , which are innovation , competitions and social investing .
They &apos;re betting a visible competition , a prize , can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues , and thereby speed the solution .
This tac@@ kles yet another assumption , that the gi@@ ver and the organization is at the center , as opposed to putting the problem at the center .
You can look to these innov@@ ators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
That leaves the final category , social investing , which is really , anyway , the biggest of them all , represented here by Xi@@ gi@@ .net .
And this , of course , tac@@ kles the biggest assumption of all , that business is business , and ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world .
X@@ igi is a new community site that &apos;s built by the community , linking and ma@@ pping this new social capital market .
It lists already 1,000 entities that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise .
So we can look to these innov@@ ators to help us remember that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital that seeks a return , the good that can be driven could be aston@@ ishing .
Now , what &apos;s really interesting here is that we &apos;re not thinking our way into a new way of acting ; we &apos;re acting our way into a new way of thinking .
Phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y is re@@ organizing itself before our very eyes .
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big gi@@ vers don &apos;t yet fulfill this aspi@@ ration , I think this is the new zeit@@ geist : open , big , fast , connected , and , let us also hope , long .
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things .
If we don &apos;t develop the stam@@ ina to stick with things  whatever it is you pick , stick with it  all of this stuff is just going to be , you know , a f@@ ad .
But I &apos;m really hop@@ eful .
And I &apos;m hop@@ eful because it &apos;s not only ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y that &apos;s re@@ organizing itself , it &apos;s also whole other por@@ tions of the social sector , and of business , that are busy challenging &quot; business as usual . &quot;
And everywhere I go , including here at TED , I feel that there is a new moral hunger that is growing .
What we &apos;re seeing is people really wres@@ tling to describe what is this new thing that &apos;s happening .

Wor@@ ds like &quot; ph@@ il@@ an@@ thro@@ capitalism , &quot; and &quot; natural capitalism , &quot; and &quot; ph@@ il@@ an@@ thro@@ entreprene@@ ur , &quot; and &quot; venture ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y . &quot;
We don &apos;t have a language for it yet .
Whatever we call it , it &apos;s new , it &apos;s beginning , and I think it &apos;s g@@ ong to quite significant .
And that &apos;s where my imagined future comes in , which I am going to call the social sing@@ ul@@ arity .
Many of you will realize that I &apos;m ri@@ pping a bit off of the science fiction writer Ver@@ nor V@@ inge &apos;s notion of a technological sing@@ ul@@ arity , where a number of trends acceler@@ ate and conver@@ ge and come together to create , really , a sho@@ ck@@ ingly new reality .
It may be that the social sing@@ ul@@ arity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a convergence of catastrop@@ hes , of environmental degra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pan@@ dem@@ ics , of poverty .
That &apos;s because our ability to confront the problems that we face has not kept pace with our ability to create them .
And as we &apos;ve heard here , it is no exagger@@ ation to say that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands as never before .
The question is , is there a positive social sing@@ ul@@ arity ?
Is there a frontier for us of how we live together ?
Our future doesn &apos;t have to be imagined .
We can create a future where hope and history r@@ hy@@ me .
But we have a problem .
Our experience to date , both individually and collec@@ tively , hasn &apos;t prepared us for what we &apos;re going to need to do , or who we &apos;re going to need to be .
We are going to need a new generation of citizen leaders willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning as rapidly as possible .
That &apos;s why I have one last thing I want to show you .
This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago of my grandfather and great@@ @@ grandfather .
This is a newspaper publisher and a ban@@ ker .
And they were great community leaders .
And , yes , they were great ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ ists .
I keep this photograph close by to me  it &apos;s in my office  because I &apos;ve always felt a mysti@@ cal connection to these two men , both of whom I never knew .
And so , in their honor , I want to offer you this blank slide .
And I want you to imagine that this a photograph of you .
And I want you to think about the community that you want to be part of creating .
Whatever that means to you .
And I want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grand@@ child , or great@@ @@ grand@@ child , or niece or nephew or god@@ @@ child , is looking at this photograph of you .
What is the story you most want for them to tell ?
Thank you very much .
Katherine Ful@@ ton : You are the future of ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y
In this up@@ lifting talk , Katherine Ful@@ ton sk@@ et@@ ches the new future of ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y  one where collaboration and innovation allow regular people to do big things , even when money is scar@@ ce . Gi@@ ving five practical examples of crow@@ d@@ driven ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ y , she calls for a new generation of citizen leaders .
I believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions  institutions that are the institutions that people in@@ habit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , work@@ places , factories , offices , etc .
And something that I see happening is something that I would like to call a sort of &quot; democra@@ tiz@@ ation of in@@ timacy . &quot;
And what do I mean by that ?
I mean that what people are doing is , in fact , they are sort of , with their communication channels , they are breaking an imposed isolation that these institutions are imposing on them .
How are they doing this ? They &apos;re doing it in a very simple way , by calling their mom from work , by IM@@ ing from their office to their friends , by tex@@ ting under the desk .
The pictures that you &apos;re seeing behind me are people that I visited in the last few months .
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most .
And somebody brought a boyfriend , somebody a father .
One young woman brought her grandfather .
For 20 years , I &apos;ve been looking at how people use channels such as email , the mobile phone , tex@@ ting , etc .
What we &apos;re actually going to see is that , fundamentally , people are communic@@ ating on a regular basis with five , six , seven of their most intimate sphere .
Now , lets take some data . Facebook .
Recently some soci@@ ologists from Facebook  Facebook is the channel that you would expect is the most enlar@@ gen@@ ing of all channels .
And an average user , said Cameron Mar@@ low , from Facebook , has about 120 friends .
But he actually talks to , has two@@ @@ way exchanges with , about four to six people on a regular base , depending on his gender .
Acade@@ mic research on instant mess@@ aging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four  anyway , less than five .
My own research on cell@@ phones and voice calls shows that 80 percent of the calls are actually made to four people . 80 percent .
And when you go to Skype , it &apos;s down to two people .
A lot of soci@@ ologists actually are quite disappointed .
I mean , I &apos;ve been a bit disappointed sometimes when I saw this data and all this deployment , just for five people .
And some soci@@ ologists actually feel that it &apos;s a closure , it &apos;s a co@@ co@@ oning , that we &apos;re dis@@ eng@@ aging from the public .
And I would actually , I would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples .
The first gentleman , he &apos;s a b@@ aker .
And so he starts working every morning at four o &apos;clock in the morning .
And around eight o &apos;clock he sort of sne@@ aks away from his oven , cle@@ ans his hands from the fl@@ our and calls his wife .
He just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
And I &apos;ve heard this story a number of times .
A young factory worker who works night shifts , who manages to sneak away from the factory floor , where there is CC@@ TV by the way , and find a corner , where at 11 o &apos;clock at night he can call his girlfriend and just say good@@ night .
Or a mother who , at four o &apos;clock , suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet to check that her children are safely home .
Then there is another couple , there is a Brazilian couple .
They &apos;ve lived in Italy for a number of years .
They Skype with their families a few times a week .
But once a fort@@ night , they actually put the computer on their dining table , pull out the web@@ cam and actually have dinner with their family in Sa@@ o Paulo . And they have a big event of it .
And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago from a very modest family of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland .
They had set up a big screen in their living room , and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother .
But Danny Miller , who is a very good an@@ thropo@@ log@@ ist who is working on Fili@@ p@@ ina mig@@ rant women who leave their children back in the Philipp@@ ines , was telling me about how much par@@ enting is going on through Skype , and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype .
And then there is the third couple . They are two friends .
They chat to each other every day , a few times a day actually .
And finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant mess@@ aging on their computers at work .
And now , obviously , they have it open .
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other .
And this is exactly what we &apos;ve been seeing with teen@@ agers and kids doing it in school , under the table , and tex@@ ting under the table to their friends .
So , none of these cases are unique .
I mean , I could tell you hundreds of them .
But what is really exceptional is the setting .
So , think of the three settings I &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office .
But it could be in a school , it could be an administration , it could be a hospital .
Three settings that , if we just step back 15 years , if you just think back 15 years , when you clo@@ cked in , when you clo@@ cked in to an office , when you clo@@ cked in to a factory , there was no contact for the whole duration of the time , there was no contact with your private sphere .
If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere .
If you were in management , oh , that was a different story .
Maybe you had a direct line .
If you were not , you maybe had to go through an operator .
But basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
And this has become such a norm of our professional lives , such a norm and such an expec@@ tation .
And it had nothing to do with technical capability .
The phones were there . But the expec@@ tation was once you moved in there your commitment was fully to the task at hand , fully to the people around you .
That was where the focus had to be .
And this has become such a cultural norm that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cle@@ av@@ age .
If you think nur@@ ser@@ y , kinder@@ garten , first years of school are just dedicated to take away the children , to make them used to staying long hours away from their family .
And then the school en@@ acts perfectly well .
It m@@ im@@ ics perfectly all the ritu@@ als that we will find in offices : ritu@@ als of entry , ritu@@ als of exit , the sched@@ ules , the uni@@ forms in this country , things that identify you , te@@ am@@ @@ building activities , team building that will allow you to basically be with a random group of kids , or a random group of people that you will have to be with for a number of time .
And of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
This only started about 150 years ago .
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy , and of industrial revolution .
When people basically had to go somewhere else to work and carry out the work .
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach , where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere .
So , until then , basically people were living on top of their tra@@ des .
They were living on top of the land they were lab@@ oring .
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working .

And if you think , it &apos;s per@@ me@@ ated our whole culture , even our cities .
If you think of medieval cities , medieval cities the bor@@ ough@@ s all have the names of the guil@@ ds and profes@@ sions that lived there .
Now we have spra@@ wling residential subur@@ bias that are well distinct from production areas and commercial areas .
And actually , over these 150 years , there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged .
So the lower the status of the job and of the person carrying out , the more removed he would be from his personal sphere .
People have taken this amazing possibility of actually being in contact all through the day or in all types of situations .
And they are doing it mas@@ sively .
The Pe@@ w Institute , which produces good data on a regular basis on , for instance , in the States , says that  and I think that this number is conservative  50 percent of anybody with email access at work is actually doing private email from his office .
I really think that the number is conservative .
In my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o &apos;clock in the morning , whatever the country .
75 percent of people admit doing private conversations from work on their mobile phones .
100 percent are using text .
The point is that this re@@ appropriation of the personal sphere is not terribly successful with all institutions .
I &apos;m always surprised the U.S. Army soci@@ ologists are discussing of the impact for instance , of soldiers in Iraq having daily contact with their families .
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access .
And every day , every single day , I read news that makes me c@@ ringe , like a $ 15 fine to kids in Texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
Im@@ medi@@ ate dis@@ miss@@ al to bus drivers in New York , if seen with a mobile phone in a hand .
Compan@@ ies blocking access to IM or to Facebook .
Behind issues of security and safety , which have always been the arguments for social control , in fact what is going on is that these institutions are trying to decide who , in fact , has a right to self determine their attention , to decide , whether they should , or not , be isolated .
And they are actually trying to block , in a certain sense , this movement of a greater possibility of in@@ timacy .
Stef@@ ana Broad@@ bent : How the Internet enables in@@ timacy
We worry that IM , tex@@ ting , Facebook are spo@@ iling human in@@ timacy , but Stef@@ ana Broad@@ bent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cultiv@@ ating deeper relationships , bringing love across barriers like distance and workplace rules .
So , how many of you have ever gotten behind the wheel of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
Maybe you &apos;re out on the road for a long day , and you just wanted to get home .
You were tired , but you felt you could drive a few more miles .
Maybe you thought , I &apos;ve had less to drink than everybody else , I should be the one to go home .
Or maybe your mind was just entirely elsewhere .
Does this sound familiar to you ?
Now , in those situations , wouldn &apos;t it be great if there was a button on your das@@ h@@ board that you could push , and the car would get you home safely ?
Now , that &apos;s been the promise of the self@@ driving car , the autonomous vehicle , and it &apos;s been the dream since at least 1939 , when General Motors show@@ cas@@ ed this idea at their Fut@@ ur@@ ama booth at the World &apos;s Fair .
Now , it &apos;s been one of those dreams that &apos;s always seemed about 20 years in the future .
Now , two weeks ago , that dream took a step forward , when the state of Nevada granted Google &apos;s self@@ driving car the very first license for an autonomous vehicle , clearly establishing that it &apos;s legal for them to test it on the roads in Nevada .
Now , California &apos;s considering similar legislation , and this would make sure that the autonomous car is not one of those things that has to stay in Vegas .
Now , in my lab at Stanford , we &apos;ve been working on autonomous cars too , but with a slightly different spin on things . You see , we &apos;ve been developing ro@@ bo@@ tic race cars , cars that can actually push themselves to the very limits of physical performance .
Now , why would we want to do such a thing ?
Well , there &apos;s two really good reasons for this .
First , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonomous car , that autonomous car should be at least as good as the very best human drivers .
Now , if you &apos;re like me , and the other 70 percent of the population who know that we are abo@@ ve@@ @@ average drivers , you understand that &apos;s a very high bar .
There &apos;s another reason as well .
Just like race car drivers can use all of the fri@@ ction between the tire and the road , all of the car &apos;s capabilities to go as fast as possible , we want to use all of those capabilities to avoid any accident we can .
Now , you may push the car to the limits not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an icy patch of road , conditions have changed .
In those situations , we want a car that is capable enough to avoid any accident that can physically be avoided .
I must confess , there &apos;s kind of a third motivation as well .
You see , I have a passion for racing .
In the past , I &apos;ve been a race car owner , a crew chief and a driving coach , although maybe not at the level that you &apos;re currently expecting .
One of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab  we &apos;ve developed several vehicles  is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonom@@ ously dri@@ fting car .
It &apos;s another one of those categories where maybe there &apos;s not a lot of competition .
But this is P@@ 1 . It &apos;s an entirely stu@@ dent@@ @@ built electric vehicle , which through using its re@@ ar@@ @@ wheel drive and fron@@ t@@ wheel ste@@ er@@ @@ by@@ @@ wire can dri@@ ft around corners .
It can get side@@ ways like a r@@ ally car driver , always able to take the ti@@ ghtest cur@@ ve , even on sli@@ pper@@ y , changing surfaces , never spinning out .
We &apos;ve also worked with Volkswagen Oracle , on Shel@@ ley , an autonomous race car that has ra@@ ced at 150 miles an hour through the Bon@@ ne@@ ville S@@ alt Fl@@ ats , gone around Th@@ under@@ hill Rac@@ eway Park in the sun , the wind and the rain , and navig@@ ated the 15@@ 3 turns and 12.@@ 4 miles of the Pi@@ kes P@@ eak Hill Cli@@ m@@ b route in Colorado with nobody at the wheel .
I guess it goes without saying that we &apos;ve had a lot of fun doing this .
But in fact , there &apos;s something else that we &apos;ve developed in the process of developing these autonomous cars .
We have developed a tremendous appreciation for the capabilities of human race car drivers .
As we &apos;ve looked at the question of how well do these cars perform , we wanted to compare them to our human counter@@ parts .
And we discovered their human counter@@ parts are amazing .
Now , we can take a map of a race track , we can take a mathemati@@ cal model of a car , and with some it@@ er@@ ation , we can actually find the fastest way around that track .
We line that up with data that we record from a professional driver , and the resem@@ b@@ lance is absolutely remarkable .
Yes , there are subtle differences here , but the human race car driver is able to go out and drive an amaz@@ ingly fast line , without the benefit of an algorith@@ m that compar@@ es the trade@@ @@ off between going as fast as possible in this corner , and s@@ having a little bit of time off of the straight over here .
Not only that , they &apos;re able to do it lap after lap after lap .
They &apos;re able to go out and consistently do this , pushing the car to the limits every single time .
It &apos;s extraordinary to watch .
You put them in a new car , and after a few l@@ aps , they &apos;ve found the fastest line in that car , and they &apos;re off to the races .
It really makes you think , we &apos;d love to know what &apos;s going on inside their brain .
So as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
We decided to instrument not only the car , but also the race car driver , to try to get a gli@@ mp@@ se into what was going on in their head as they were doing this .
Now , this is Dr. L@@ ene Har@@ bot@@ t applying electro@@ des to the head of John Mor@@ ton .
John Mor@@ ton is a former Can@@ @@ Am and IM@@ SA driver , who &apos;s also a class champion at Le M@@ ans .
Fantastic driver , and very willing to put up with graduate students and this sort of research .
She &apos;s putting electro@@ des on his head so that we can monitor the electrical activity in John &apos;s brain as he races around the track .
Now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
However , neuro@@ scientists have identified certain patterns that let us te@@ ase out some very important aspects of this .
For instance , the resting brain tends to generate a lot of al@@ pha waves .
In contrast , th@@ eta waves are associated with a lot of co@@ gni@@ tive activity , like visual processing , things where the driver is thinking quite a bit .
Now , we can measure this , and we can look at the relative power between the th@@ eta waves and the al@@ pha waves .
This gives us a measure of mental work@@ load , how much the driver is actually challenged co@@ gni@@ tively at any point along the track .
Now , we wanted to see if we could actually record this on the track , so we headed down south to Lag@@ una Sec@@ a .
Lag@@ una Sec@@ a is a legendary ra@@ ce@@ way about halfway between Sal@@ inas and Monter@@ ey .
It has a cur@@ ve there called the Cor@@ k@@ screw .
Now , the Cor@@ k@@ screw is a ch@@ ic@@ ane , followed by a quick right@@ @@ handed turn as the road drops three stories .
Now , the strategy for driving this as explained to me was , you aim for the bush in the distance , and as the road falls away , you realize it was actually the top of a tree .
All right , so thanks to the Re@@ vs Program at Stanford , we were able to take John there and put him behind the wheel of a 1960 Porsche Ab@@ ar@@ th Car@@ r@@ era .
Life is way too short for boring cars .
So , here you see John on the track , he &apos;s going up the hill  Oh ! Somebody liked that  and you can see , actually , his mental work@@ load  measuring here in the red bar  you can see his actions as he approaches .
Now watch , he has to down@@ shift .
And then he has to turn left .
Look for the tree , and down .
Not surpris@@ ingly , you can see this is a pretty challenging task .
You can see his mental work@@ load spi@@ ke as he goes through this , as you would expect with something that requires this level of complexity .
But what &apos;s really interesting is to look at areas of the track where his mental work@@ load doesn &apos;t increase .
I &apos;m going to take you around now to the other side of the track .
Turn three . And John &apos;s going to go into that corner and the rear end of the car is going to begin to slide out .
He &apos;s going to have to correct for that with steering .
So watch as John does this here .
Watch the mental work@@ load , and watch the steering .
The car begins to slide out , dramatic man@@ eu@@ ver to correct it , and no change whatsoever in the mental work@@ load .
Not a challenging task .
In fact , entirely re@@ flexi@@ ve .
Now , our data processing on this is still preliminary , but it really seems that these phenomen@@ al fe@@ ats that the race car drivers are performing are instinc@@ tive .
They are things that they have simply learned to do .
It requires very little mental work@@ load for them to perform these amazing fe@@ ats .

And their actions are fantastic .
This is exactly what you want to do on the steering wheel to catch the car in this situation .
Now , this has given us tremendous insight and inspiration for our own autonomous vehicles .
We &apos;ve started to ask the question : Can we make them a little less algorith@@ mic and a little more intuitive ?
Can we take this re@@ flexi@@ ve action that we see from the very best race car drivers , introduce it to our cars , and maybe even into a system that could get onto your car in the future ?
That would take us a long step along the road to autonomous vehicles that drive as well as the best humans .
But it &apos;s made us think a little bit more deeply as well .
Do we want something more from our car than to simply be a ch@@ auff@@ eur ?
Do we want our car to perhaps be a partner , a coach , someone that can use their understanding of the situation to help us reach our potential ?
Can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of refle@@ x and intu@@ ition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
So , as we move forward into this technological future , I want you to just pause and think of that for a moment .
What is the ideal balance of human and machine ?
And as we think about that , let &apos;s take inspiration from the absolutely amazing capabilities of the human body and the human mind .
Thank you .
Chris Ger@@ des : The future race car  15@@ 0@@ mp@@ h , and no driver
Autonom@@ ous cars are coming  and they &apos;re going to drive better than you . Chris Ger@@ des reveals how he and his team are developing ro@@ bo@@ tic race cars that can drive at 150 mp@@ h while avoiding every possible accident . And yet , in studying the bra@@ in@@ waves of professional racing drivers , Ger@@ des says he has gained a new appreciation for the instincts of professional drivers . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
So today , I &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighbor@@ hoo@@ ds .
The first one is happening right here in Chicago .
Brenda Pal@@ ms@@ @@ Far@@ ber was hired to help ex@@ @@ convic@@ ts re@@ enter society and keep them from going back into prison .
Currently , taxpayers spend about 6@@ 0,000 dollars per year sending a person to jail .
We know that two@@ @@ thirds of them are going to go back .
I find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like Head Start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the future .
Or  think about it  that 6@@ 0,000 dollars is more than what it costs to send one person to Harvard as well .
But Brenda , not being pha@@ sed by stuff like that , took a look at her challenge and came up with a not@@ @@ so@@ @@ obvious solution : create a business that produces skin care products from honey .
Okay , it might be obvious to some of you ; it wasn &apos;t to me .
It &apos;s the basis of growing a form of social innovation that has real potential .
She hired seem@@ ingly un@@ emplo@@ yable men and women to care for the bees , harvest the honey and make valu@@ e@@ added products that they marketed themselves , and that were later sold at Wh@@ ole F@@ oods .
She combined employment experience and training with life skills they needed , like anger@@ @@ management and te@@ am@@ work , and also how to talk to future employers about how their experiences actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned and their e@@ ag@@ ern@@ ess to learn more .
Less than four percent actually go back to jail .
So these young men and women learned j@@ ob@@ @@ read@@ iness and life skills through bee keeping and became productive citizens in the process .
Talk about a sweet beginning .
Now , I &apos;m going to take you to Los Angeles , and lots of people know that L.A. has its issues .
But I &apos;m going to talk about L.A. &apos; s water issues right now .
They have not enough water on most days and too much to handle when it ra@@ ins .
Currently , 20 percent of California &apos;s energy consumption is used to pump water into mostly Southern California .
Their spending loads , loads , to channel that rain@@ water out into the ocean when it ra@@ ins and floods as well .
Now Andy Lip@@ kis is working to help L.A. cut infrastructure costs associated with water management and urban heat island  linking trees , people and technology to create a more li@@ vable city .
All that green stuff actually naturally absor@@ bs storm water , also helps cool our cities .
Because , come to think about it , do you really want air@@ @@ conditioning , or is it a cooler room that you want ?
How you get it shouldn &apos;t make that much of a difference .
So a few years ago , L.A. County decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
And Andy and his team discovered that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars on as@@ p@@ halt to sur@@ round the schools themselves .
And by presenting a really strong economic case , they convinced the L.A. government that replacing that as@@ p@@ halt with trees and other green@@ ery , that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy than they spend on hor@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural infrastructure .
So ultimately , 20 million square feet of as@@ p@@ halt was replaced or avoided , and electrical consumption for air@@ @@ conditioning went down , while employment for people to maintain those grounds went up , resulting in a net@@ @@ savings to the system , but also health@@ ier students and schools system employees as well .
Now Judy B@@ onds is a coal min@@ er &apos;s daughter .
Her family has eight generations in a town called Whit@@ es@@ ville , West Virginia .
And if anyone should be cl@@ inging to the former glory of the coal mining history , and of the town , it should be Judy .
But the way coal is mined right now is different from the deep mines that her father and her father &apos;s father would go down into and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people .
Now , two dozen men can tear down a mountain in several months , and only for about a few years &apos; worth of coal .
That kind of technology is called &quot; mountain@@ top removal . &quot;
It can make a mountain go from this to this in a few short months .
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places  it &apos;s filled with the residue of explosives and coal .
When we visited , it gave some of the people we were with this strange little c@@ ough after being only there for just a few hours or so  not just min@@ ers , but everybody .
And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed and her water poisoned .
And the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emp@@ tied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy on an intact mountain , and one that was reduced in elev@@ ation by over 2,000 feet .
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs , or centuries of clean energy with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency based on technical skills , and developing local knowledge about how to get the most out of that region &apos;s wind .
She calculated the up@@ @@ front cost and the pay@@ back over time , and it &apos;s a net@@ @@ plus on so many levels for the local , national and global economy .
It &apos;s a longer pay@@ back than mountain@@ top removal , but the wind energy actually pays back forever .
Now mountain@@ top removal pays very little money to the locals , and it gives them a lot of misery .
The water is turned into go@@ o .
Most people are still unemployed , leading to most of the same kinds of social problems that unemployed people in inner cities also experience  drug and alcohol abuse , domestic abuse , teen pregnancy and poor he@@ ath , as well .
Now Judy and I  I have to say  totally related to each other .
Not quite an obvious alliance .
I mean , literally , her hom@@ et@@ own is called Whit@@ es@@ ville , West Virginia .
I mean , they are not  they ain &apos;t competing for the birth@@ place of hip hop title or anything like that .
But the back of my T@@ shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; Save the end@@ anger@@ ed h@@ ill@@ billi@@ es . &quot;
So home@@ girls and h@@ ill@@ billi@@ es we got it together and totally understand that this is what it &apos;s all about .
But just a few months ago , Judy was diagno@@ sed with sta@@ ge@@ @@ three lung cancer .
Yeah .
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain .
And I just find it so bizarre that she &apos;s suffering from the same thing that she tried so hard to protect people from .
But her dream of Co@@ al River Mountain Wind is her legacy .
And she might not get to see that mountain@@ top .
But rather than writing yet some kind of manifes@@ to or something , she &apos;s leaving behind a business plan to make it happen .
That &apos;s what my home@@ girl is doing .
So I &apos;m so proud of that .
But these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
They &apos;re all problem sol@@ vers , and they &apos;re just some of the many examples that I really am privileged to see , meet and learn from in the examples of the work that I do now .
I was really lucky to have them all featured on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show called The@@ Pro@@ mis@@ ed@@ Land@@ .org .
Now they &apos;re all very practical vision@@ aries .
They take a look at the demands that are out there  beauty products , healthy schools , electricity  and how the money &apos;s flowing to meet those demands .
And when the che@@ apest solutions involve reducing the number of jobs , you &apos;re left with unemployed people , and those people aren &apos;t cheap .
In fact , they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens , and they include gener@@ ation@@ ally im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished , traumati@@ zed v@@ ets returning from the Middle East , people coming out of jail .
And for the veter@@ ans in particular , the V.@@ A. said there &apos;s a six@@ @@ fold increase in mental health pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als by v@@ ets since 2003 .
I think that number &apos;s probably going to go up .
They &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive  and in terms of the lik@@ el@@ ihood for domestic abuse , drug and alcohol abuse , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
So these three guys all understand how to produc@@ tively channel dollars through our local economies to meet existing market demands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
And there are plenty of other examples like that .
One problem : waste handling and unemployment .
Even when we think or talk about recycling , lots of rec@@ ycl@@ able stuff ends up getting inciner@@ ated or in land@@ f@@ ills and leaving many municip@@ alities , di@@ version rates  they leave much to be rec@@ ycl@@ ed .
And where is this waste handled ? Usually in poor communities .
And we know that eco@@ @@ industrial business , these kinds of business models  there &apos;s a model in Europe called the eco@@ @@ industrial park , where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another , or you use rec@@ ycl@@ ed materials to make goods that you can actually use and sell .
We can create these local markets and incentives for rec@@ ycl@@ ed materials to be used as raw materials for manufacturing .
And in my hom@@ et@@ own , we actually tried to do one of these in the Bron@@ x , but our mayor decided what he wanted to see was a jail on that same spot .
Fortunately  because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs  but after many years , the city wanted to build a jail .
They &apos;ve since abandoned that project , thank goodness .
Another problem : un@@ healthy food systems and unemployment .
Work@@ ing@@ @@ class and poor urban Americans are not benef@@ iting economically from our current food system .
It rel@@ ies too much on transportation , chemical fertili@@ zation , big use of water and also refriger@@ ation .

Meg@@ a agricultural operations often are responsible for pois@@ oning our water@@ ways and our land , and it produces this incredibly un@@ healthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity .
And so we know &quot; urban ag &quot; is a big bu@@ zz topic this time of the year , but it &apos;s mostly gar@@ dening , which has some value in community building  lots of it  but it &apos;s not in terms of creating jobs or for food production .
The numbers just aren &apos;t there .
Part of my work now is really laying the ground@@ work to integrate urban ag and rural food systems to ha@@ sten the de@@ mise of the 3,@@ 000@@ @@ mile salad by creating a national brand of urban@@ @@ grown produce in every city , that uses regional growing power and au@@ g@@ ments it with indoor growing facilities , owned and operated by small gro@@ wers , where now there are only consumers .
This can support seas@@ onal farmers around metro areas who are losing out because they really can &apos;t meet the year@@ @@ round demand for produce .
It &apos;s not a competition with rural farm ; it &apos;s actually reinfor@@ cements .
It allies in a really positive and economically viable food system .
The goal is to meet the cities &apos; institutional demands for hospitals , senior centers , schools , day@@ care centers , and produce a network of regional jobs , as well .
This is smart infrastructure .
And how we manage our built environment affects the health and well@@ @@ being of people every single day .
Our municip@@ alities , rural and urban , play the operational course of infrastructure  things like waste disposal , energy demand , as well as social costs of unemployment , drop@@ @@ out rates , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates and the imp@@ acts of various public health costs .
Smart infrastructure can provide cost@@ @@ saving ways for municip@@ alities to handle both infrastructure and social needs .
And we want to shift the systems that open the doors for people who were formerly tax bur@@ dens to become part of the tax base .
And imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
So I &apos;m hoping you can see a little theme here .
These examples indicate a trend .
I haven &apos;t created it , and it &apos;s not happening by accident .
I &apos;m notic@@ ing that it &apos;s happening all over the country , and the good news is that it &apos;s growing .
And we all need to be invested in it .
It is an essential pillar to this country &apos;s recovery .
And I call it &quot; hom@@ et@@ own security . &quot;
The recession has us re@@ eling and fear@@ ful , and there &apos;s something in the air these days that is also very em@@ power@@ ing .
It &apos;s a reali@@ zation that we are the key to our own recovery .
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities where we think local and we act local .
And when we do that , our neighbors  be they nex@@ t@@ door , or in the next state , or in the next country  The sum of the local is the global .
Hom@@ et@@ own security means re@@ building our natural defen@@ ses , putting people to work , restor@@ ing our natural systems .
Hom@@ et@@ own security means creating wealth here at home , instead of destroying it overseas .
Tac@@ kling social and environmental problems at the same time with the same solution y@@ ields great cost savings , wealth generation and national security .
Many great and inspir@@ ing solutions have been generated across America .
The challenge for us now is to identify and support countless more .
Now , hom@@ et@@ own security is about taking care of your own , but it &apos;s not like the old saying , &quot; charity begins at home . &quot;
I recently read a book called &quot; Love Lea@@ dership &quot; by John Hope Br@@ y@@ ant .
And it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
And reading that book made me re@@ examine that theory because I need to explain what I mean by that .
See , my dad was a great , great man in many ways .
He grew up in the se@@ greg@@ ated South , escaped ly@@ n@@ ching and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my si@@ bl@@ ings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
But , like all of us , he had some problems .
And his was gambling , compul@@ sively .
To him that phrase , &quot; Char@@ ity begins at home , &quot; meant that my pay@@ day  or someone else &apos;s  would just happen to coinci@@ de with his lucky day .
So you need to help him out .
And sometimes I would loan him money from my after@@ @@ school or summer jobs , and he always had the great intention of paying me back with interest , of course , after he hit it big .
And he did sometimes , believe it or not , at a rac@@ et@@ rack in Los Angeles  one reason to love L.A.  back in the 19@@ 40@@ s .
He made 15@@ ,000 dollars cash and bought the house that I grew up in .
So I &apos;m not that unhappy about that .
But listen , I did feel oblig@@ ated to him , and I grew up  then I grew up .
And I &apos;m a grown woman now , and I have learned a few things along the way .
To me , charity often is just about giving , because you &apos;re supposed to , or because it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always done , or it &apos;s about giving until it hurts .
I &apos;m about providing the means to build something that will grow and intensi@@ fy its original investment and not just require greater giving next year  I &apos;m not trying to feed the habit .
I spent some years watching how good intentions for community em@@ power@@ ment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and em@@ power it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
And over the past 20 years , we &apos;ve spent record amounts of ph@@ il@@ anth@@ rop@@ ic dollars on social problems , yet educational out@@ comes , mal@@ nutrition , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , o@@ bes@@ ity , di@@ abetes , income dispar@@ ity , they &apos;ve all gone up with some exceptions  in particular , inf@@ ant mortality among people in poverty  but it &apos;s a great world that we &apos;re bringing them into as well .
And I know a little bit about these issues , because , for many years , I spent a long time in the non@@ profit industrial complex , and I &apos;m a recover@@ ing executive director , two years clean .
But during that time , I realized that it was about projects and developing them on the local level that really was going to do the right thing for our communities .
But I really did struggle for financial support .
The greater our success , the less money came in from foundations .
And I tell you , being on the TED stage and winning a Mac@@ Arthur in the same exact year gave everyone the impression that I had arrived .
And by the time I &apos;d moved on , I was actually covering a third of my agency &apos;s budget deficit with speaking fees .
And I think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
But since then , the park that was just a dump and was featured at a T@@ ED@@ 2006 Talk became this little thing .
But I did in fact get married in it .
Over here .
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .
The South Bron@@ x Green@@ way was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006 .
Since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimul@@ us package money to come and get here .
And we love this , because I love construction now , because we &apos;re watching these things actually happen .
So I want everyone to understand the critical importance of shi@@ fting charity into enterprise .
I started my firm to help communities across the country realize their own potential to improve everything about the quality of life for their people .
Hom@@ et@@ own security is next on my to@@ @@ do list .
What we need are people who see the value in investing in these types of local enterprises , who will partner with folks like me to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation as well as understand the growing social costs of business as usual .
We need to work together to embrace and repair our land , repair our power systems and repair ourselves .
It &apos;s time to stop building the shopping m@@ alls , the pris@@ ons , the sta@@ di@@ ums and other tributes to all of our collective failures .
It is time that we start building living monuments to hope and possibility .
Thank you very much .
Maj@@ ora Carter : 3 stories of local eco@@ @@ entrepreneur@@ ship
The future of green is local  and entrepreneur@@ ial . In her talk , Maj@@ ora Carter brings us the stories of three people who are saving their own communities while saving the planet . Call it &quot; hom@@ et@@ own security . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
&quot; Even in purely non@@ religious terms , homo@@ sexu@@ ality represents a mis@@ use of the sexual fac@@ ulty .
It is a pathetic little secon@@ d@@ rate substitute for reality  a pi@@ ti@@ able flight from life .
As such , it deserves no compassion , it deserves no treatment as minority mar@@ tyr@@ dom , and it deserves not to be deemed anything but a per@@ ni@@ cious sickness . &quot;
That &apos;s from Time magazine in 1966 , when I was three years old .
And last year , the president of the United States came out in favor of gay marriage .
And my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
How did an illness become an identity ?
When I was perhaps six years old , I went to a shoe store with my mother and my brother .
And at the end of buying our shoes , the sales@@ man said to us that we could each have a balloon to take home .
My brother wanted a red balloon , and I wanted a pink balloon .
My mother said that she thought I &apos;d really rather have a blue balloon .
But I said that I definitely wanted the pink one .
And she reminded me that my favorite color was blue .
The fact that my favorite color now is blue , but I &apos;m still gay   is evidence of both my mother &apos;s influence and its limits .
When I was little , my mother used to say , &quot; The love you have for your children is like no other feeling in the world .
And until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like . &quot;
And when I was little , I took it as the greatest compliment in the world that she would say that about par@@ enting my brother and me .
And when I was an ad@@ ol@@ es@@ cent , I thought that I &apos;m gay , and so I probably can &apos;t have a family .
And when she said it , it made me anxious .
And after I came out of the closet , when she continued to say it , it made me fur@@ ious .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m gay . That &apos;s not the direction that I &apos;m headed in .
And I want you to stop saying that . &quot;
About 20 years ago , I was asked by my edi@@ tors at The New York Times Magazine to write a piece about deaf culture .
And I was rather taken ab@@ ack .
I had thought of de@@ af@@ ness entirely as an illness .
Those poor people , they couldn &apos;t hear .
have proceeded 800 lines.

They l@@ acked hearing , and what could we do for them ?
And then I went out into the deaf world .
I went to deaf clubs .
I saw performances of deaf theater and of deaf poetry .
I even went to the Miss Dea@@ f America contest in Nas@@ h@@ ville , Tenn@@ es@@ see where people compla@@ ined about that sl@@ ur@@ ry Southern signing .
And as I pl@@ ung@@ ed deeper and deeper into the deaf world , I become convinced that de@@ af@@ ness was a culture and that the people in the deaf world who said , &quot; We don &apos;t lack hearing , we have membership in a culture , &quot; were saying something that was viable .
It wasn &apos;t my culture , and I didn &apos;t particularly want to rush off and join it , but I appreciated that it was a culture and that for the people who were members of it , it felt as valuable as Lat@@ ino culture or gay culture or Jewish culture .
It felt as valid perhaps even as American culture .
Then a friend of a friend of mine had a daughter who was a d@@ warf .
And when her daughter was born , she suddenly found herself confron@@ ting questions that now began to seem quite res@@ on@@ ant to me .
She was facing the question of what to do with this child .
Should she say , &quot; You &apos;re just like everyone else but a little bit shorter ? &quot;
Or should she try to construct some kind of d@@ warf identity , get involved in the Little People of America , become aware of what was happening for d@@ war@@ fs ?
And I suddenly thought , most deaf children are born to hearing parents .
Those hearing parents tend to try to cure them .
Those deaf people discover community somehow in ad@@ ol@@ esc@@ ence .
Most gay people are born to straight parents .
Those straight parents often want them to function in what they think of as the mainstre@@ am world , and those gay people have to discover identity later on .
And here was this friend of mine looking at these questions of identity with her d@@ warf daughter .
And I thought , there it is again : A family that perc@@ ei@@ ves itself to be normal with a child who seems to be extraordinary .
And I hat@@ ched the idea that there are really two kinds of identity .
There are vertical identi@@ ties , which are passed down gener@@ ation@@ ally from parent to child .
Those are things like eth@@ ni@@ city , frequently nationality , language , often religion .
Those are things you have in common with your parents and with your children .
And while some of them can be difficult , there &apos;s no attempt to cure them .
You can argue that it &apos;s harder in the United States  our current presidency notwithstanding  to be a person of color .
And yet , we have nobody who is trying to ensure that the next generation of children born to Afri@@ can@@ @@ Americans and Asi@@ ans come out with cre@@ amy skin and yellow hair .
There are these other identi@@ ties which you have to learn from a pe@@ er group .
And I call them horizontal identi@@ ties , because the pe@@ er group is the horizontal experience .
These are identi@@ ties that are alien to your parents and that you have to discover when you get to see them in pe@@ ers .
And those identi@@ ties , those horizontal identi@@ ties , people have almost always tried to cure .
And I wanted to look at what the process is through which people who have those identi@@ ties come to a good relationship with them .
And it seemed to me that there were three levels of acceptance that needed to take place .
There &apos;s self@@ acceptance , there &apos;s family acceptance , and there &apos;s social acceptance .
And they don &apos;t always coinci@@ de .
And a lot of the time , people who have these conditions are very angry because they feel as though their parents don &apos;t love them , when what actually has happened is that their parents don &apos;t accept them .
Love is something that ideally is there un@@ condi@@ tionally throughout the relationship between a parent and a child .
But acceptance is something that takes time .
It always takes time .
One of the d@@ war@@ fs I got to know was a guy named Clinton Brown .
When he was born , he was diagno@@ sed with di@@ astrop@@ hic d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , a very dis@@ ab@@ ling condition , and his parents were told that he would never walk , he would never talk , he would have no intellectual capacity , and he would probably not even recognize them .
And it was suggested to them that they leave him at the hospital so that he could die there quietly .
And his mother said she wasn &apos;t going to do it .
And she took her son home .
And even though she didn &apos;t have a lot of educational or financial advantages , she found the best doctor in the country for dealing with di@@ astrop@@ hic d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , and she got Clinton en@@ rolled with him .
And in the course of his childhood , he had 30 major surgical procedures .
And he spent all this time stuck in the hospital while he was having those procedures , as a result of which he now can walk .
And while he was there , they sent tut@@ ors around to help him with his school work .
And he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
And he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contem@@ pl@@ ated by any member of his family .
He was the first one in his family , in fact , to go to college , where he lived on campus and drove a speci@@ all@@ y@@ fitted car that accommod@@ ated his unusual body .
And his mother told me this story of coming home one day  and he went to college nearby  and she said , &quot; I saw that car , which you can always recognize , in the parking lot of a bar , &quot; she said .
&quot; And I thought to myself , they &apos;re six feet tall , he &apos;s three feet tall .
Two beers for them is four beers for him . &quot;
She said , &quot; I knew I couldn &apos;t go in there and interrupt him , but I went home , and I left him eight messages on his cell phone . &quot;
She said , &quot; And then I thought , if someone had said to me when he was born that my future worry would be that he &apos;d go drinking and driving with his college buddies  &quot; And I said to her , &quot; What do you think you did that helped him to emerge as this charming , accomplished , wonderful person ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; What did I do ? I loved him , that &apos;s all .
Clinton just always had that light in him .
And his father and I were lucky enough to be the first to see it there . &quot;
I &apos;m going to quote from another magazine of the &apos; 60s .
This one is from 1968  The Atlantic Mon@@ thly , voice of liberal America  written by an important bio@@ eth@@ ic@@ ist .
He said , &quot; There is no reason to feel guilty about putting a Down syn@@ drome child away , whether it is put away in the sense of hidden in a san@@ it@@ arium or in a more responsible , le@@ thal sense .
It is sad , yes  dreadful . But it carries no guilt .
True guilt arises only from an offense against a person , and a Down &apos;s is not a person . &quot;
There &apos;s been a lot of ink given to the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the treatment of gay people .
The fact that our attitude has changed is in the head@@ lines every day .
But we forget how we used to see people who had other differences , how we used to see people who were disabled , how in@@ human we held people to be .
And the change that &apos;s been accomplished there , which is almost equally radical , is one that we pay not very much attention to .
One of the families I inter@@ viewed , Tom and Karen Rob@@ ards , were taken ab@@ ack when , as young and successful New Yor@@ kers , their first child was diagno@@ sed with Down syn@@ drome .
They thought the educational opportunities for him were not what they should be , and so they decided they would build a little center  two class@@ rooms that they started with a few other parents  to educ@@ ate kids with D.@@ S .
And over the years , that center grew into something called the Coo@@ ke Center , where there are now thousands upon thousands of children with intellectual disabilities who are being taught .
In the time since that Atlantic Mon@@ thly story ran , the life expec@@ tan@@ cy for people with Down syn@@ drome has tri@@ pled .
The experience of Down syn@@ drome people includes those who are actors , those who are writers , some who are able to live fully independently in ad@@ ul@@ th@@ ood .
The Rob@@ ards had a lot to do with that .
And I said , &quot; Do you regret it ?
Do you wish your child didn &apos;t have Down syn@@ drome ?
Do you wish you &apos;d never heard of it ? &quot;
And interest@@ ingly his father said , &quot; Well , for David , our son , I regret it , because for David , it &apos;s a difficult way to be in the world , and I &apos;d like to give David an easier life .
But I think if we lost everyone with Down syn@@ drome , it would be a catastrop@@ hic loss . &quot;
And Karen Rob@@ ards said to me , &quot; I &apos;m with Tom .
For David , I would cure it in an instant to give him an easier life .
But speaking for myself  well , I would never have believed 23 years ago when he was born that I could come to such a point  speaking for myself , it &apos;s made me so much better and so much kinder and so much more pur@@ pos@@ eful in my whole life , that speaking for myself , I wouldn &apos;t give it up for anything in the world . &quot;
We live at a point when social acceptance for these and many other conditions is on the up and up .
And yet we also live at the moment when our ability to eliminate those conditions has reached a height we never imagined before .
Most deaf in@@ fan@@ ts born in the United States now will receive Co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , which are put into the brain and connected to a receiver , and which allow them to acquire a fac@@ si@@ mile of hearing and to use oral speech .
A compound that has been tested in mi@@ ce , BM@@ N@@ @@ 111 , is useful in preventing the action of the ach@@ on@@ drop@@ las@@ ia gene .
Ach@@ on@@ drop@@ las@@ ia is the most common form of d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , and mi@@ ce who have been given that substance and who have the ach@@ on@@ drop@@ las@@ ia gene , grow to full size .
Test@@ ing in humans is around the corner .
There are blood tests which are making progress that would pick up Down syn@@ drome more clearly and earlier in pregn@@ ancies than ever before , making it easier and easier for people to eliminate those pregn@@ ancies , or to terminate them .
And so we have both social progress and medical progress .
And I believe in both of them .
I believe the social progress is fantastic and meaningful and wonderful , and I think the same thing about the medical progress .
But I think it &apos;s a tragedy when one of them doesn &apos;t see the other .
And when I see the way they &apos;re inter@@ sec@@ ting in conditions like the three I &apos;ve just described , I sometimes think it &apos;s like those moments in grand opera when the hero reali@@ zes he loves the hero@@ ine at the exact moment that she lies exp@@ iring on a di@@ van .
We have to think about how we feel about c@@ ures altogether .
And a lot of the time the question of par@@ enth@@ ood is , what do we vali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
Jim Sin@@ clair , a prominent au@@ tism activ@@ ist , said , &quot; When parents say &apos; I wish my child did not have au@@ tism , &apos; what they &apos;re really saying is &apos; I wish the child I have did not exist and I had a different , non@@ au@@ ti@@ stic child instead . &apos; Read that again . This is what we hear when you mour@@ n over our existence .
This is what we hear when you pray for a cure  that your fon@@ dest wish for us is that someday we will cease to be and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces . &quot;
It &apos;s a very extreme point of view , but it points to the reality that people engage with the life they have and they don &apos;t want to be cured or changed or eliminated .
They want to be whoever it is that they &apos;ve come to be .

One of the families I inter@@ viewed for this project was the family of Dylan K@@ leb@@ old who was one of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the Colum@@ bine mass@@ acre .
It took a long time to persuade them to talk to me , and once they agreed , they were so full of their story that they couldn &apos;t stop telling it .
And the first weekend I spent with them  the first of many  I recorded more than 20 hours of conversation .
And on Sunday night , we were all exhausted .
We were sitting in the kitchen . Sue K@@ leb@@ old was fixing dinner .
And I said , &quot; If Dylan were here now , do you have a sense of what you &apos;d want to ask him ? &quot;
And his father said , &quot; I sure do .
I &apos;d want to ask him what the hell he thought he was doing . &quot;
And Sue looked at the floor , and she thought for a minute .
And then she looked back up and said , &quot; I would ask him to forgive me for being his mother and never knowing what was going on inside his head . &quot;
When I had dinner with her a couple of years later  one of many d@@ inners that we had together  she said , &quot; You know , when it first happened , I used to wish that I had never married , that I had never had children .
If I hadn &apos;t gone to Ohio State and crossed paths with Tom , this child wouldn &apos;t have existed and this terrible thing wouldn &apos;t have happened .
But I &apos;ve come to feel that I love the children I had so much that I don &apos;t want to imagine a life without them .
I recognize the pain they caused to others , for which there can be no forgiveness , but the pain they caused to me , there is , &quot; she said .
&quot; So while I recognize that it would have been better for the world if Dylan had never been born , I &apos;ve decided that it would not have been better for me . &quot;
I thought it was surprising how all of these families had all of these children with all of these problems , problems that they mostly would have done anything to avoid , and that they had all found so much meaning in that experience of par@@ enting .
And then I thought , all of us who have children love the children we have , with their fla@@ ws .
If some glorious angel suddenly desc@@ ended through my living room ceiling and offered to take away the children I have and give me other , better children  more polite , fun@@ nier , ni@@ cer , smarter  I would c@@ ling to the children I have and pray away that atro@@ cious spectac@@ le .
And ultimately I feel that in the same way that we test fl@@ am@@ e@@ ret@@ ard@@ ant pa@@ jam@@ as in an infer@@ no to ensure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reaches across the stove , so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of par@@ enting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
It turns out that while each of these individual differences is si@@ lo@@ ed  there are only so many families dealing with schi@@ zop@@ hren@@ ia , there are only so many families of children who are trans@@ gender , there are only so many families of pro@@ di@@ gies  who also face similar challenges in many ways  there are only so many families in each of those categories  but if you start to think that the experience of negotiating difference within your family is what people are addressing , then you discover that it &apos;s a nearly universal phenomenon .
Iron@@ ically , it turns out , that it &apos;s our differences , and our negotiation of difference , that unite us .
I decided to have children while I was working on this project .
And many people were aston@@ ished and said , &quot; But how can you decide to have children in the midst of studying everything that can go wrong ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m not studying everything that can go wrong .
What I &apos;m studying is how much love there can be , even when everything appears to be going wrong . &quot;
I thought a lot about the mother of one disabled child I had seen , a severely disabled child who died through car@@ e@@ gi@@ ver neg@@ lect .
And when his ashes were inter@@ red , his mother said , &quot; I pray here for forgiveness for having been twice robbed , once of the child I wanted and once of the son I loved . &quot;
And I figured it was possible then for anyone to love any child if they had the effective will to do so .
So my husband is the biological father of two children with some lesbian friends in Min@@ ne@@ a@@ polis .
I had a close friend from college who &apos;d gone through a divorce and wanted to have children .
And so she and I have a daughter , and mother and daughter live in Texas .
And my husband and I have a son who lives with us all the time of whom I am the biological father , and our surro@@ gate for the pregnancy was Laura , the lesbian mother of Oliver and Lucy in Min@@ ne@@ a@@ polis .
So the shor@@ th@@ and is five parents of four children in three states .
And there are people who think that the existence of my family somehow under@@ mines or weak@@ ens or damages their family .
And there are people who think that families like mine shouldn &apos;t be allowed to exist .
And I don &apos;t accept sub@@ trac@@ tive models of love , only addi@@ tive ones .
And I believe that in the same way that we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on , so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the eco@@ sphere of kindness .
The day after our son was born , the pedi@@ atri@@ cian came into the hospital room and said she was concerned .
He wasn &apos;t extending his legs appropriately .
She said that might mean that he had brain damage .
In so far as he was extending them , he was doing so asy@@ mmet@@ ri@@ cally , which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action .
And he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydro@@ cep@@ hal@@ us .
And as she told me all of these things , I felt the very center of my being po@@ uring out onto the floor .
And I thought , here I had been working for years on a book about how much meaning people had found in the experience of par@@ enting children who are disabled , and I didn &apos;t want to join their number .
Because what I was encoun@@ tering was an idea of illness .
And like all parents since the dawn of time , I wanted to protect my child from illness .
And I wanted also to protect myself from illness .
And yet , I knew from the work I had done that if he had any of the things we were about to start testing for , that those would ultimately be his identity , and if they were his identity they would become my identity , that that illness was going to take a very different shape as it un@@ fol@@ ded .
We took him to the MR@@ I machine , we took him to the C@@ AT scanner , we took this day@@ @@ old child and gave him over for an ar@@ terial blood draw .
We felt helpless .
And at the end of five hours , they said that his brain was completely clear and that he was by then extending his legs correctly .
And when I asked the pedi@@ atri@@ cian what had been going on , she said she thought in the morning he had probably had a cra@@ mp .
But I thought how my mother was right .
I thought , the love you have for your children is unlike any other feeling in the world , and until you have children , you don &apos;t know what it feels like .
I think children had ens@@ n@@ ared me the moment I connected fa@@ ther@@ hood with loss .
But I &apos;m not sure I would have noticed that if I hadn &apos;t been so in the thick of this research project of mine .
I &apos;d encountered so much strange love , and I fell very naturally into its be@@ wit@@ ching patterns .
And I saw how spl@@ end@@ or can ill@@ umin@@ ate even the most ab@@ ject vulner@@ abilities .
During these 10 years , I had witnessed and learned the terri@@ fying joy of unbe@@ arable responsibility , and I had come to see how it conqu@@ ers everything else .
And while I had sometimes thought the parents I was inter@@ viewing were fools , ens@@ la@@ ving themselves to a lifetime &apos;s journey with their than@@ kl@@ ess children and trying to breed identity out of misery , I realized that day that my research had built me a pl@@ ank and that I was ready to join them on their ship .
Thank you .
Andrew Solomon : Love , no matter what
What is it like to raise a child who &apos;s different from you in some fundamental way ? In this quietly moving talk , writer Andrew Solomon shares what he learned from talking to dozens of parents  asking them : What &apos;s the line between un@@ conditional love and un@@ conditional acceptance ?
Most people don &apos;t know that when I went to high school in this country  I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculp@@ tor .
And I came from a very privileged background . I was very lucky .
My family was wealthy , and my father believed in one thing , and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted .
And I announced I wanted to be a sculp@@ tor in Paris .
And he was a clever man . He sort of said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s OK , but you &apos;ve done very well in your math SAT@@ s . &quot;
In fact , I &apos;d got an 800 . And he thought I did very well  and I did , too  in the arts : this was my passion .
And he said &quot; If you go to MIT , &quot; to which I had been given early admission , &quot; I will pay for every year you &apos;re at MIT , in graduate or under@@ graduate  as much as you want  I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris . &quot;
And I thought that was the best deal in town , so I accepted it immediately .
And I decided that if I was good in art , and I was good in mathemati@@ cs , I &apos;d study architecture , which was the bl@@ ending of the two .
I went and told my head@@ master that , at pre@@ p school .
And I said to him what I was doing , that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathemati@@ cs put together .
He said to me something that just went completely over my head .
He said , &quot; You know , I like grey suits , and I like pin@@ @@ stri@@ ped suits , but I don &apos;t like grey pin@@ @@ stri@@ ped suits . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; What a turkey this guy is , &quot; and I went off to MIT .
I studied architecture , then did a second degree in architecture , and then actually quickly realized that it wasn &apos;t architecture .
That really , the mixing of art and science was computers , and that that really was the place to bring both , and enjoyed a career doing that .
And probably , if I were to fill out Jim Cit@@ rin &apos;s scale , I &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equ@@ ation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
And after doing this for a long time , and the Media Lab passing the bat@@ on on , I thought , &quot; Well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project .
Something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had . &quot;
And in the case of the Media Lab , knowing a lot of people , knowing people who were either execu@@ tives or wealthy , and also not having , in my own case , a career to worry about anymore .
My career , I mean , I &apos;d done my career .
Didn &apos;t have to worry about ear@@ ning money .
Didn &apos;t have to worry about what people thought about me .
And I said , &quot; Boy , let &apos;s really do something that takes advantage of all these features , &quot; and thought that if we could address education , by le@@ ver@@ aging the children , and bringing to the world the access of the computers , that that was really the thing we should do .
Never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
It &apos;s taken at three o &apos;clock in the morning , without the permission of the company .
It &apos;s about two weeks old . There they are , folks .
If you look at the picture , you &apos;ll see they &apos;re st@@ acked up .
Those are conve@@ y@@ or belts that go around .
This is one of the conve@@ y@@ or belts with the thing going by , but then you &apos;ll see the ones up above .
What happens is , they burn into flash memory the software , and then test them for a few hours .
But you &apos;ve got to have the thing moving on the assembly line , because it &apos;s constant .
So they go around in this loop , which is why you see them up there .
So this was great for us because it was a real turning point . But it goes back .
This picture was taken in 1982 , just before the IBM PC was even announced .
Se@@ ym@@ our Pap@@ ert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself .
But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here .

And when people tell me , &quot; Who &apos;s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids ? &quot;
I say to myself , &quot; What planet do you come from ? &quot;
Okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room  I don &apos;t care how tech@@ ie you are  there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them de@@ bug it . OK ?
We all need help , even those of us who are very seas@@ oned .
This picture of Se@@ ym@@ our  25 years ago . Se@@ ym@@ our made a very simple observation in 1968 , and then basically presented it in 1970  April 11 to be precise  called &quot; Tea@@ ching Children Th@@ inking . &quot;
What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently , and when they de@@ bug the programs , they come the closest to learning about learning .
That was very important , and in some sense , we &apos;ve lost that .
Kids don &apos;t program enough and boy , if there &apos;s anything I hope this brings back , it &apos;s programming to kids .
It &apos;s really important . Using applications is OK , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
This is being launched with three languages in it : Squ@@ eak , Logo , and a third , that I &apos;ve never even seen before .
The point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side .
This photograph is very important because it &apos;s much later .
This is in the early 200@@ 0s . My son , Dimit@@ ri  who &apos;s here , many of you know Dimit@@ ri  went to Cambo@@ dia , set up this school that we had built , just as the school connected it to the Internet .
And these kids had their lap@@ tops . But it was really what spir@@ ited this , plus the influence of Joe and others . We started One Laptop per Child .
This is the same village in Cambo@@ dia , just a couple of months ago .
These kids are real pro@@ s . There were just 7@@ ,000 machines out there being tested by kids . Being a non@@ profit is absolutely fundamental .
Everybody advised me not to be a non@@ profit , but they were all wrong .
And the reason being a non@@ profit is important is actually two@@ fold .
There are many reasons , but the two that merit the little bit of time is : one , the clarity of purpose is there . The moral purpose is clear .
I can see any head of state , any executive I want , at any time , because I &apos;m not selling lap@@ tops . OK ? I have no shareholders .
Whether we sell , it doesn &apos;t make any difference whatsoever .
The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical . And the second is very counter@@ intuitive  you can get the best people in the world .
If you look at our professional services , including search firms , including communications , including legal services , including banking , they &apos;re all pro bon@@ o . And it &apos;s not to save money .
We &apos;ve got money in the bank . It &apos;s because you get the best people .
You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission , and they &apos;re the best people .
We couldn &apos;t afford to hire a CF@@ O . We put out a job description for a CF@@ O at zero salary , and we had a qu@@ eu@@ e of people .
It allows you to team up with people . The U.@@ N. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos;re profit making . So announ@@ cing this with Ko@@ fi Ann@@ an was very important , and the U.@@ N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . And this was the machine we were showing before I met Y@@ ves Be@@ har .
And while this machine in some sense is silly , in retro@@ spect , it actually served a very important purpose .
That pen@@ cil@@ @@ yellow c@@ rank was remembered by everybody .
Everybody remembered the pen@@ cil@@ @@ yellow c@@ rank . It &apos;s different .
It was getting its power in a different way . It &apos;s kind of child@@ like .
Even though this wasn &apos;t the direction we went because the c@@ rank  it really is stupid to have it on board , by the way .
In spite of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do  having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
You want a separate thing , like the AC adap@@ tor .
I didn &apos;t bring one with me , but they really work much better off@@ @@ board .
And then , I could tell you lots about the laptop , but I decided on just four things .
Just keep in mind  because there are other people , including Bill Gates , who said , &quot; Gee , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
That computer is unlike anything you &apos;ve had , and does things  there are four of them  that you don &apos;t come close to . And it &apos;s very important to be low power , and I hope that &apos;s picked up more by the industry .
That the reason that you want to be below two wat@@ ts is that &apos;s roughly what you can generate with your upper body .
Du@@ al@@ @@ mode display  that sun@@ light display &apos;s fantastic .
We were using it at lunch today in the sun@@ light , and the more sun@@ light the better .
And that was really critical . The mes@@ h network , it &apos;ll become comm@@ on@@ place .
And of course , &quot; ru@@ gged &quot; goes without saying .
And the reason I think design matters isn &apos;t because I wanted to go to art school .
And by the way , when I graduated from MIT , I thought the worst and si@@ lli@@ est thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years .
So , I didn &apos;t do that . But design matters for a number of reasons .
The most important being that it is the best way to make an in@@ expensive product .
Most people make in@@ expensive products by taking cheap design , cheap labor , cheap components , and making a cheap laptop .
And , in English , the word &quot; cheap &quot; has a double meaning , which is really appropriate , because it &apos;s cheap , in the pe@@ jor@@ ative sense , as well as in@@ expensive .
But if you take a different approach , and you think of very lar@@ ge@@ @@ scale integration , very advanced materials , very advanced manufacturing  so you &apos;re po@@ uring chemicals in one end , i@@ Po@@ ds are spe@@ wing out the other  and really cool design , that &apos;s what we wanted to do .
And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Y@@ ves and I obviously didn &apos;t compare notes .
These are his sli@@ des , and so I don &apos;t have to talk about them .
But it was really , to us , very important as a strategy .
It wasn &apos;t just to kind of make it cute , because somebody  you know , good design is very important .
Y@@ ves showed one of the power@@ @@ generating devices .
The mes@@ h network , the reason I  and I won &apos;t go into it in great detail  but when we deliver lap@@ tops to kids in the remot@@ est and poorest parts of the world , they &apos;re connected . There &apos;s not just lap@@ tops .
And so , we have to drop in satellite dishes . We put in gener@@ ators .
It &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . These can talk to each other .
If you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
If you &apos;re in the jungle , it &apos;s about 500 meters . So if a kid bi@@ cycles home , or walks a few miles , they &apos;re going to be off the grid , so to speak .
They &apos;re not going to be near another laptop , so you have to nail these onto a tree , and sort of , get it .
You don &apos;t call Ver@@ iz@@ on or Sp@@ rin@@ t . You build your own network .
And that &apos;s very important , the user interface .
We are launching with 18 key@@ boards . English is by far the minority .
Latin is relatively rare , too . You just look at some of the languages .
I &apos;m willing to suspect some of you hadn &apos;t even heard of them before .
Is there anybody in the room , one person , unless you work with OL@@ PC , is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that &apos;s on the screen ? There &apos;s only one hand  so you get it .
Yes , you &apos;re right . He &apos;s right . It &apos;s Am@@ har@@ ic , it &apos;s Ethiop@@ ian . In Ethiop@@ ia , there &apos;s never been a keyboard .
There is no keyboard standard because there &apos;s no market .
And this is the big difference .
Again , when you &apos;re a non@@ profit , you look at children as a mission , not as a market .
So we went to Ethiop@@ ia , and we helped them make a keyboard .
And this will become the standard Ethiop@@ ian keyboard .
So what I want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
And we changed strategy completely . I decided at the beginning  it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning , it &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing now  is to go to six countries .
Big countries , one of them is not so big , but it &apos;s rich .
Here &apos;s the six . We went to the six , and in each case the head of state said he would do it , he &apos;d do a million .
In the case of Gad@@ da@@ fi , he &apos;d do 1.2 million , and that they would launch it .
We thought , this is exactly the right strategy , get it out , and then the little countries could sort of pig@@ gy@@ back on these big countries .
And so I went to each of those countries at least six times , met with the head of state probably two or three times .
In each case , got the ministers , went through a lot of the stuff .
This was a period in my life where I was traveling 3@@ 30 days per year .
Not something you &apos;d envy or want to do .
In the case of Libya , it was a lot of fun meeting Gad@@ da@@ fi in his tent .
The cam@@ el smells were unbelievable .
And it was 45 degrees C. I mean , this was not what you &apos;d call a cool experience . And former countries  I say former , because none of them really came through this summer  there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity , make a press release .
So we went to smaller ones . Uruguay , bless their hearts .
Small country , not so rich . President said he &apos;d do it , and guess what ?
He did do it . The tender had nothing in it that related to us , nothing specific about sun@@ light@@ @@ read@@ able , mes@@ h@@ @@ network , low@@ @@ power , but just a van@@ illa laptop proposal .
And guess what ? We won it hands down .
When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay , the first 100,000 , boom , went to OL@@ PC .
The next day  the next day , not even 24 hours had passed  in Peru , the president of Peru said , &quot; We &apos;ll do 250 . &quot; And boom , a little dom@@ ino effect .
The president of R@@ wand@@ a stepped in and said he would do it .
The president of Ethiop@@ ia said he would do it .
And boom , boom , boom . The president of Mon@@ go@@ lia .
And so what happens is , these things start to happen with these countries  still not enough .
Add up all those countries , it didn &apos;t quite get to thing , so we said , &quot; Let &apos;s start a program in the United States . &quot; So , end of August , early September , we decide to do this . We announced it near the middle , end  just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place .
We thought that was a good time to announce it .
La@@ un@@ ched it on the 12 of November .
We said it would be just for a short period until the 26 . We &apos;ve extended it until the 31 .

And the &quot; Give One , Get One &quot; program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested .
The first day it was just wild . And then we said , &quot; Well , let &apos;s get people to give many . Not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . &quot; And that &apos;s where you come in .
And that &apos;s where I think it &apos;s very important . I don &apos;t want you all to go out and buy 400 dollars worth of lap@@ tops . Okay ? Do it , but that &apos;s not going to help . Okay ?
If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars , whatever it is , 300 people in the room doing it  yeah , great .
I want you do something else .
And it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , I invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
Tell people about it ! It &apos;s got to become vi@@ ral , OK ?
Use your mailing lists . People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists .
Get your friends to give one , get one .
And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people , that would be fantastic .
I won &apos;t dwell on the pricing at all .
Just to say that when you do the &quot; Give One , Get One , &quot; a lot of press is a bit about , &quot; They didn &apos;t make it , it &apos;s 18@@ 8 dollars , it &apos;s not 100 . &quot;
It will be 100 in two years . It will go below 100 .
We &apos;ve ple@@ dged not to add features , but to bring that price down .
But it was the countries that wanted it to go up , and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons . So what you can do  I &apos;ve just said it . Don &apos;t just give one , get one .
I just want to end with one last one . This one is not even 24@@ @@ hours old , or maybe it &apos;s 24@@ @@ hours .
The first kids got their lap@@ tops . They got them by ship , and I &apos;m talking now about 7@@ ,000 , 8@@ ,000 at a time went out this week .
They went to Uruguay , Peru , Mexico .
And it &apos;s been slow coming , and we &apos;re only making about 5,000 a week , but we hope , we hope , sometime in next year , maybe by the middle of the year , to hit a million a month . Now put that number , and a million isn &apos;t so much . It &apos;s not a big number .
We &apos;re selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year .
But a million a month in lap@@ top@@ @@ land is a big number .
And the world production today , everybody combined , making lap@@ tops , is five million a month . So I &apos;m standing here telling you that sometime next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world production .
And if we do that , there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there .
And we hope if you have EG two years from now , or whenever you have it again , I won &apos;t have bad breath , and I will be invited back , and will have , hopefully by then , maybe 100 million out there to children .
Thank you .

Nicholas Ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te talks about how One Laptop per Child is doing , two years in . Speaking at the EG conference while the first X@@ O lap@@ tops roll off the production line , he rec@@ aps the controversi@@ es and recomm@@ its to the goals of this far@@ @@ reaching project .
I , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on Earth who live in cities .
And there are days  I don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys  but there are days when I pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much I rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
And some days , that can even be a little scary .
But what I &apos;m here to talk to you about today is how that same inter@@ dependence is actually an extremely powerful social infrastructure that we can actually har@@ ness to help heal some of our deep@@ est ci@@ vic issues , if we apply open source collaboration .
A couple of years ago , I read an article by New York Times writer Michael Poll@@ an in which he argued that growing even some of our own food is one of the best things that we can do for the environment .
Now at the time that I was reading this , it was the middle of the winter and I definitely did not have room for a lot of dirt in my New York City apartment .
So I was basically just willing to settle for just reading the next Wi@@ red magazine and finding out how the experts were going to figure out how to solve all these problems for us in the future .
But that was actually exactly the point that Michael Poll@@ an was making in this article  was it &apos;s precisely when we hand over the responsibility for all these things to specialists that we cause the kind of m@@ esses that we see with the food system .
So , I happen to know a little bit from my own work about how NASA has been using hydro@@ poni@@ cs to explore growing food in space .
And you can actually get optimal nutri@@ tional yield by running a kind of high@@ @@ quality liquid soil over plants &apos; root systems .
Now to a vegetable plant , my apartment has got to be about as foreign as outer space .
But I can offer some natural light and year@@ @@ round climate control .
F@@ ast@@ @@ forward two years later : we now have window farms , which are vertical , hydro@@ po@@ nic platforms for food@@ @@ growing in@@ doors .
And the way it works is that there &apos;s a pump at the bottom , which perio@@ dically sends some of this liquid nutri@@ ent solution up to the top , which then tri@@ ckles down through plants &apos; root systems that are suspended in clay pel@@ lets  so there &apos;s no dirt involved .
Now light and temperature vary with each window &apos;s micro@@ climate , so a window farm requires a farmer , and she must decide what kind of crops she is going to put in her window farm , and whether she is going to feed her food organ@@ ically .
Back at the time , a window farm was no more than a technically complex idea that was going to require a lot of testing .
And I really wanted it to be an open project , because hydro@@ poni@@ cs is one of the fastest growing areas of pat@@ enting in the United States right now and could possibly become another area like Mon@@ san@@ to , where we have a lot of corporate intellectual property in the way of people &apos;s food .
So I decided that , instead of creating a product , what I was going to do was open this up to a whole bunch of co@@ developers .
The first few systems that we created , they kind of worked .
We were actually able to grow about a salad a week in a typical New York City apartment window .
And we were able to grow cherry tom@@ atoes and cu@@ cum@@ bers , all kinds of stuff .
But the first few systems were these le@@ aky , loud power@@ @@ gu@@ zz@@ lers that Martha Stewart would definitely never have approved .
So to bring on more co@@ developers , what we did was we created a social media site on which we published the designs , we explained how they worked , and we even went so far as to point out everything that was wrong with these systems .
And then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
So actually now on this website , we have 18@@ ,000 people .
And we have window farms all over the world .
What we &apos;re doing is what NASA or a large corporation would call R &amp; amp ; D , or research and development .
But what we call it is R &amp; amp ; D@@ @@ I@@ Y , or research and develop it yourself .
So for example , Jackson came along and suggested that we use air pumps instead of water pumps .
It took building a whole bunch of systems to get it right , but once we did , we were able to cut our carbon foot@@ print nearly in half .
Tony in Chicago has been taking on growing experiments , like lots of other window farmers , and he &apos;s been able to get his stra@@ w@@ berries to fruit for nine months of the year in low@@ @@ light conditions by simply changing out the organic nutri@@ ents .
And window farmers in Finland have been custom@@ izing their window farms for the dark days of the Finnish w@@ inters by out@@ fitting them with LED grow lights that they &apos;re now making open source and part of the project .
So window farms have been evol@@ ving through a rapid ver@@ sion@@ ing process similar to software .
And with every open source project , the real benefit is the inter@@ play between the specific concerns of people custom@@ izing their systems for their own particular concerns and the universal concerns .
So my core team and I are able to concentrate on the improvements that really benefit everyone .
And we &apos;re able to look out for the needs of new@@ com@@ ers .
So for do@@ @@ it@@ @@ your@@ sel@@ fers , we provide free , very well@@ @@ tested instructions so that anyone , anywhere around the world , can build one of these systems for free .
And there &apos;s a patent pending on these systems as well that &apos;s held by the community .
And to fund the project , we partner to create products that we then sell to schools and to individuals who don &apos;t have time to build their own systems .
Now within our community , a certain culture has appeared .
In our culture , it is better to be a tes@@ ter who supports someone else &apos;s idea than it is to be just the idea guy .
What we get out of this project is we get support for our own work , as well as an experience of actually contributing to the environmental movement in a way other than just screwing in new light bul@@ bs .
But I think that Ei@@ leen expres@@ ses best what we really get out of this , which is the actual joy of collaboration .
So she expres@@ ses here what it &apos;s like to see someone halfway across the world having taken your idea , built upon it and then acknowle@@ dging you for contributing .
If we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environ@@ ment@@ alists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
Open source projects tend to have a momentum of their own .
And what we &apos;re seeing is that R &amp; amp ; D@@ @@ I@@ Y has moved beyond just window farms and LE@@ Ds into solar panels and aqu@@ apo@@ nic systems .
And we &apos;re building upon innovations of generations who went before us .
And we &apos;re looking ahead at generations who really need us to ret@@ ool our lives now .
So we ask that you join us in re@@ dis@@ covering the value of citizens united , and to declare that we are all still pion@@ eers .
Brit@@ ta Riley : A garden in my apartment
Brit@@ ta Riley wanted to grow her own food . So she and her friends developed a system for growing plants in dis@@ car@@ ded plastic bottles  resear@@ ching , testing and t@@ wea@@ king the system using social media , trying many variations at once and quickly arriving at the optimal system . Call it distributed DI@@ Y . And the results ? Del@@ icious . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
So a friend of mine who &apos;s a political scientist , he told me several months ago exactly what this month would be like .
He said , you know , there &apos;s this fiscal cliff coming , it &apos;s going to come at the beginning of 2013 .
Both parties absolutely need to resolve it , but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it .
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it &apos;s due , so he said , December , you &apos;re just going to see lots of angry negotiations , negotiations breaking apart , reports of phone calls that aren &apos;t going well , people saying nothing &apos;s happening at all , and then sometime around Christmas or New Year &apos;s , we &apos;re going to hear , &quot; Okay , they resolved everything . &quot;
He told me that a few months ago . He said he &apos;s 98 percent positive they &apos;re going to resolve it , and I got an email from him today saying , all right , we &apos;re basically on track , but now I &apos;m 80 percent positive that they &apos;re going to resolve it .
And it made me think . I love studying these moments in American history when there was this fren@@ zy of parti@@ san anger , that the economy was on the ver@@ ge of total collapse .
The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be and how it would be backed up , with Alexander Hamilton saying , &quot; We need a central bank , the First Bank of the United States , or else the dollar will have no value .
This economy won &apos;t work , &quot; and Thomas Jefferson saying , &quot; The people won &apos;t trust that .
They just fought off a king . They &apos;re not going to accept some central authority . &quot;
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy , and at every moment , different parti@@ s@@ ans saying , &quot; Oh my God , the economy &apos;s about to collapse , &quot; and the rest of us just going about , spending our bucks on whatever it is we wanted to buy .
To give you a quick pri@@ mer on where we are , a quick refres@@ her on where we are .
So the fiscal cliff , I was told that that &apos;s too parti@@ san a thing to say , although I can &apos;t remember which party it &apos;s supporting or attacking .
People say we should call it the fiscal slo@@ pe , or we should call it an au@@ ster@@ ity crisis , but then other people say , no , that &apos;s even more parti@@ san .
So I just call it the self@@ imposed , self@@ destructive arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem .
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like .
So this is a pro@@ jection of U.S. debt as a percentage of our overall economy , of GDP .
The light blue dot@@ ted line represents the Congres@@ sional Budget Office &apos;s best guess of what will happen if Congress really doesn &apos;t do anything , and as you can see , sometime around 20@@ 27 , we reach Greek levels of debt , somewhere around 130 percent of GDP , which tells you that some time in the next 20 years , if Congress does absolutely nothing , we &apos;re going to hit a moment where the world &apos;s investors , the world &apos;s bond buyers , are going to say , &quot; We don &apos;t trust America anymore . We &apos;re not going to lend them any money , except at really high interest rates . &quot;
And at that moment our economy collap@@ ses .
But remember , Greece is there today .
We &apos;re there in 20 years . We have lots and lots of time to avoid that crisis , and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis .
Here &apos;s another way to look at exactly the same problem .
have proceeded 1200 lines.

The dark blue line is how much the government sp@@ ends .
The light blue line is how much the government gets in .
And as you can see , for most of recent history , except for a brief period , we have consistently spent more than we take in . Thus the national debt .
But as you can also see , pro@@ jected going forward , the gap wi@@ dens a bit and raises a bit , and this graph is only through 20@@ 21 .
It gets really , really ugly out towards 20@@ 30 .
And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is .
The Democrats , they say , well , this isn &apos;t a big deal .
We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap , especially if we raise taxes on the rich .
The Re@@ public@@ ans say , hey , no , no , we &apos;ve got a better idea .
Why don &apos;t we lower both lines ?
Why don &apos;t we lower government spending and lower government taxes , and then we &apos;ll be on an even more favor@@ able long@@ term deficit tra@@ jec@@ tory ?
And behind this powerful dis@@ agreement between how to close that gap , there &apos;s the worst kind of cy@@ ni@@ cal party politics , the worst kind of in@@ sider baseball , lob@@ b@@ ying , all of that stuff , but there &apos;s also this power@@ fully interesting , respec@@ tful dis@@ agreement between two fundamentally different economic philosophi@@ es .
And I like to think , when I picture how Re@@ public@@ ans see the economy , what I picture is just some amaz@@ ingly well@@ @@ engine@@ ered machine , some perfect machine .
Unfortunately , I picture it made in Germany or Japan , but this amazing machine that &apos;s constantly sc@@ ouring every bit of human ende@@ a@@ vor and taking resources , money , labor , capital , machinery , away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts , and while this might cause temporary dis@@ location , what it does is it builds up the more productive areas and lets the less productive areas fade away and die , and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient , so much rich@@ er for everybody .
And this view generally believes that there is a role for government , a small role , to set the rules so people aren &apos;t lying and cheating and hurting each other , maybe , you know , have a police force and a fire department and an army , but to have a very limited reach into the mechanisms of this machinery .
And when I picture how Democrats and Democ@@ ra@@ tic@@ @@ le@@ aning econom@@ ists picture this economy , most Democratic econom@@ ists are , you know , they &apos;re capit@@ alists , they believe , yes , that &apos;s a good system a lot of the time .
It &apos;s good to let markets move resources to their more productive use .
But that system has tons of problems .
We@@ alth pil@@ es up in the wrong places .
We@@ alth is ripped away from people who shouldn &apos;t be called un@@ productive .
That &apos;s not going to create an equ@@ itable , fair society .
That machine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about racism , about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us , and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses , or from rich@@ er sources , and give them to other sources .
And when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the st@@ akes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything .
And I can get really des@@ pa@@ iring . I &apos;ve spent a lot of the last few years really depressed about this , until this year , I learned something that I felt really excited about . I feel like it &apos;s really good news , and it &apos;s so shocking , I don &apos;t like saying it , because I think people won &apos;t believe me .
But here &apos;s what I learned .
The American people , taken as a whole , when it comes to these issues , to fiscal issues , are moderate , pra@@ g@@ matic cent@@ ris@@ ts .
And I know that &apos;s hard to believe , that the American people are moderate , pra@@ g@@ matic cent@@ ris@@ ts .
But let me explain what I &apos;m thinking .
When you look at how the federal government sp@@ ends money , so this is the battle right here , 55 percent , more than half , is on Social Security , Medi@@ care , Medic@@ aid , a few other health programs , 20 percent defense , 19 percent discre@@ tionary , and six percent interest .
So when we &apos;re talking about cutting government spending , this is the pie we &apos;re talking about , and Americans overwhel@@ m@@ ingly , and it doesn &apos;t matter what party they &apos;re in , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly like that big 55 percent ch@@ unk .
They like Social Security . They like Medi@@ care .
They even like Medic@@ aid , even though that goes to the poor and in@@ dig@@ ent , which you might think would have less support .
And they do not want it fundamentally touched , although the American people are remark@@ ably comfortable , and Democrats roughly equal to Re@@ public@@ ans , with some minor t@@ wea@@ ks to make the system more stable .
Social Security is fairly easy to fix .
The rumors of its de@@ mise are always greatly exagger@@ ated .
So gradually raise Social Security retirement age , maybe only on people not yet born .
Americans are about 50 / 50 , whether they &apos;re Democrats or Re@@ public@@ ans .
Re@@ duce Medi@@ care for very wealthy sen@@ iors , sen@@ iors who make a lot of money . Don &apos;t even eliminate it . Just reduce it .
People generally are comfortable with it , Democrats and Re@@ public@@ ans .
Ra@@ ise medical health care contributions ?
Everyone hates that equally , but Re@@ public@@ ans and Democrats hate that together .
And so what this tells me is , when you look at the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems , we are not a nation that &apos;s power@@ fully divided on the major , major issue .
We &apos;re comfortable with it needing some t@@ wea@@ ks , but we want to keep it .
We &apos;re not open to a discussion of eliminating it .
Now there is one issue that is hyper@@ @@ parti@@ san , and where there is one party that is just spend , spend , spend , we don &apos;t care , spend some more , and that of course is Re@@ public@@ ans when it comes to military defense spending .
They way out@@ weigh Democrats .
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that presents a more difficult issue .
I should also note that the &#91; discre@@ tionary &#93; spending , which is about 19 percent of the budget , that is Democratic and Republi@@ can issues , so you do have welfare , food st@@ amps , other programs that tend to be popular among Democrats , but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Inter@@ ior in@@ duc@@ ements for oil dri@@ lling and other things , which tend to be popular among Re@@ public@@ ans .
Now when it comes to taxes , there is more dis@@ agreement .
That &apos;s a more parti@@ san area .
You have Democrats overwhel@@ m@@ ingly suppor@@ tive of raising the income tax on people who make 25@@ 0,000 dollars a year , Re@@ public@@ ans sort of against it , although if you break it out by income , Re@@ public@@ ans who make less than 75@@ ,000 dollars a year like this idea .
So basically Re@@ public@@ ans who make more than 25@@ 0,000 dollars a year don &apos;t want to be ta@@ xed .
Ra@@ ising taxes on investment income , you also see about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Re@@ public@@ ans are comfortable with that idea .
This brings up a really important point , which is that we tend in this country to talk about Democrats and Re@@ public@@ ans and think there &apos;s this little group over there called independ@@ ents that &apos;s , what , two percent ?
If you add Democrats , you add Re@@ public@@ ans , you &apos;ve got the American people .
But that is not the case at all .
And it has not been the case for most of modern American history .
R@@ ough@@ ly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats .
Around a quarter say that they are Re@@ public@@ ans .
A tiny little sli@@ ver call themselves liber@@ tari@@ ans , or soci@@ alists , or some other small third party , and the largest block , 40 percent , say they &apos;re independ@@ ents .
So most Americans are not parti@@ san , and most of the people in the independent camp fall somewhere in between , so even though we have tremendous over@@ lap between the views on these fiscal issues of Democrats and Re@@ public@@ ans , we have even more over@@ lap when you add in the independ@@ ents .
Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues .
We get to hate each other on gun control and abortion and the environment , but on these fiscal issues , these important fiscal issues , we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say .
And in fact , there &apos;s this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think , and that group is econom@@ ists .
I talk to a lot of econom@@ ists , and back in the &apos; 70@@ s and &apos; 80@@ s it was ugly being an econom@@ ist .
You were in what they called the sal@@ t@@ water camp , meaning Harvard , Princ@@ eton , MIT , Stanford , Ber@@ kel@@ ey , or you were in the fresh@@ water camp , University of Chicago , University of Ro@@ chester .
You were a free market capit@@ alist econom@@ ist or you were a Ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian liberal econom@@ ist , and these people didn &apos;t go to each other &apos;s wed@@ dings , they sn@@ ub@@ bed each other at conferences .
It &apos;s still ugly to this day , but in my experience , it is really , really hard to find an econom@@ ist under 40 who still has that kind of way of seeing the world .
The vast majority of econom@@ ists  it is so un@@ cool to call yourself an ide@@ olo@@ gue of either camp .
The phrase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a post@@ doc or you &apos;re a professor , a 38@@ @@ year@@ @@ old economics professor , is , &quot; I &apos;m an em@@ pi@@ ric@@ ist .
I go by the data . &quot;
And the data is very clear .
None of these major theories have been completely successful .
The 20th century , the last hundred years , is ri@@ dd@@ led with disastrous examples of times that one school or the other tried to explain the past or predict the future and just did an awful , awful job , so the economics profession has acquired some degree of mo@@ dest@@ y .
They still are an awfully arrogant group of people , I will assure you , but they &apos;re now arrogant about their im@@ parti@@ ality , and they , too , see a tremendous range of potential out@@ comes .
And this non@@ parti@@ s@@ ans@@ hip is something that exists , that has existed in secret in America for years and years and years .
I &apos;ve spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major organizations that survey American political attitudes : Pe@@ w Research , the University of Chicago &apos;s National Op@@ inion Research Center , and the most important but the least known is the American National Ele@@ ction Studies group that is the world &apos;s longest , most respected po@@ ll of political attitudes .
They &apos;ve been doing it since 1948 , and what they show consistently throughout is that it &apos;s almost impossible to find Americans who are consistent ide@@ ologically , who consistently support , &quot; No we mustn &apos;t tax , and we must limit the size of government , &quot; or , &quot; No , we must encourage government to play a larger role in re@@ distribution and correc@@ ting the ills of capitalism . &quot;
Those groups are very , very small .
The vast majority of people , they pick and choose , they see compromise and they change over time when they hear a better argument or a worse argument .
And that part of it has not changed .
What has changed is how people respond to vague questions .
If you ask people vague questions , like , &quot; Do you think there should be more government or less government ? &quot;
&quot; Do you think government should &quot; — especially if you use loaded language  &quot; Do you think the government should provide hand@@ outs ? &quot;
Or , &quot; Do you think the government should re@@ distribute ? &quot;
Then you can see radical parti@@ san change .
But when you get specific , when you actually ask about the actual tax@@ ing and spending issues under consideration , people are remark@@ ably centr@@ ist , they &apos;re remark@@ ably open to compromise .
So what we have , then , when you think about the fiscal cliff , don &apos;t think of it as the American people fundamentally can &apos;t stand each other on these issues and that we must be ripped apart into two separate war@@ ring nations .
Think of it as a tiny , tiny number of ancient econom@@ ists and mis@@ representative ide@@ olo@@ gues have captured the process .
And they &apos;ve captured the process through familiar ways , through a primary system which encourages that small group of people &apos;s voices , because that small group of people , the people who answer all y@@ eses or all no@@ es on those ideological questions , they might be small but every one of them has a blog , every one of them has been on Fox or MS@@ N@@ BC in the last week .
Every one of them becomes a lou@@ der and lou@@ der voice , but they don &apos;t represent us .
They don &apos;t represent what our views are .
And that gets me back to the dollar , and it gets me back to remin@@ ding myself that we know this experience .
We know what it &apos;s like to have these people on TV , in Congress , yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adopt their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton .
In 19@@ 13 , we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve , when it was created , with vicious , angry arguments over how it would be con@@ stituted , and a general agreement that the way it was con@@ stituted was the worst possible compromise , a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing , this dollar , but then everyone agre@@ eing , okay , so long as we &apos;re on the gold standard , it should be okay .
The Fed can &apos;t mess it up so badly .
But then we got off the gold standard for individuals during the Depression and we got off the gold standard as a source of international currency coordination during Richard Nixon &apos;s presidency .
Each of those times , we were on the ver@@ ge of complete collapse .

And nothing happened at all .
Th@@ rough@@ out it all , the dollar has been one of the most long@@ @@ standing , stable , reasonable currencies , and we all use it every single day , no matter what the people screaming about tell us , no matter how scared we &apos;re supposed to be .
And this long@@ term fiscal picture that we &apos;re in right now , I think what is most ma@@ dden@@ ing about it is , if Congress were simply able to show not that they agree with each other , not that they &apos;re able to come up with the best possible compromise , but that they are able to just begin the process towards compromise , we all instantly are better off .
The fear is that the world is watching .
The fear is that the longer we delay any solution , the more the world will look to the U.@@ S .
not as the bed@@ rock of stability in the global economy , but as a place that can &apos;t resolve its own fights , and the longer we put that off , the more we make the world nervous , the higher interest rates are going to be , the quicker we &apos;re going to have to face a day of horrible cal@@ am@@ ity .
And so just the act of compromise itself , and sustained , real compromise , would give us even more time , would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain and reach even more compromise down the road .
So I &apos;m in the media . I feel like my job to make this happen is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise , to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms that do pol@@ ari@@ ze us , but to just talk about it like what it is , not an existen@@ tial crisis , not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views , but a math problem , a really sol@@ vable math problem , one where we &apos;re not all going to get what we want and one where , you know , there &apos;s going to be a little pain to spread around .
But the more we address it as a practical concern , the sooner we can resolve it , and the more time we have to resolve it , para@@ dox@@ ically .
Thank you .
Adam Davi@@ dson : What we learned from te@@ et@@ ering on the fiscal cliff
At the end of 2012 , the US political system was headed for the &quot; fiscal cliff &quot;  a budget im@@ passe that could only be solved with bi@@ parti@@ san agreement . Adam Davi@@ dson , co@@ host of &quot; Planet Money , &quot; shares surprising data on how bi@@ parti@@ san we truly are  and hin@@ ts at the dis@@ connect between representatives and the people they represent .
When I was little  and by the way , I was little once  my father told me a story about an 18th century watch@@ maker .
And what this guy had done : he used to produce these fab@@ ul@@ ously beautiful watches .
And one day , one of his customers came into his workshop and asked him to clean the watch that he &apos;d bought .
And the guy took it apart , and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels .
And as he did so , his customer noticed that on the back side of the balance wheel was an en@@ gra@@ ving , were words .
And he said to the guy , &quot; Why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
And the watch@@ maker turned around and said , &quot; God can see it . &quot;
Now I &apos;m not in the least bit religious , neither was my father , but at that point , I noticed something happening here .
I felt something in this ple@@ x@@ us of blood vessels and nerves , and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere , I guess .
But I felt something .
And it was a physi@@ ological response .
And from that point on , from my age at the time , I began to think of things in a different way .
And as I took on my career as a designer , I began to ask myself the simple question : Do we actually think beauty , or do we feel it ?
Now you probably know the answer to this already .
You probably think , well , I don &apos;t know which one you think it is , but I think it &apos;s about feeling beauty .
And so I then moved on into my design career and began to find some exciting things .
One of the most early work was done in automotive design  some very exciting work was done there .
And during a lot of this work , we found something , or I found something , that really fascin@@ ated me , and maybe you can remember it .
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off , click click , when you closed the door in a car ?
And then somebody , I think it was BMW , introduced a light that went out slowly .
Remember that ?
I remember it clearly .
Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that ?
I remember sitting there thinking , this is fantastic .
In fact , I &apos;ve never found anybody that doesn &apos;t like the light that goes out slowly .
I thought , well what the hell &apos;s that about ?
So I started to ask myself questions about it .
And the first was , I &apos;d ask other people : &quot; Do you like it ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Why ? &quot; And they &apos;d say , &quot; Oh , it feels so natural , &quot; or , &quot; It &apos;s nice . &quot;
I thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
Can we cut down a little bit further , because , as a designer , I need the voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary , I need the keyboard , of how this actually works .
And so I did some experiments .
And I suddenly realized that there was something that did exactly that  light to dark in six seconds  exactly that .
Do you know what it is ? Anyone ?
You see , using this bit , the thin@@ ky bit , the slow bit of the brain  using that .
And this isn &apos;t a think , it &apos;s a feel .
And would you do me a favor ?
For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is , will you feel stuff ?
I don &apos;t need you to think so much as I want you to feel it .
I felt a sense of relaxation temper@@ ed with anticip@@ ation .
And that thing that I found was the cinema or the theater .
It &apos;s actually just happened here  light to dark in six seconds .
And when that happens , are you sitting there going , &quot; No , the movie &apos;s about to start , &quot; or are you going , &quot; That &apos;s fantastic . I &apos;m looking forward to it .
I get a sense of anticip@@ ation &quot; ?
Now I &apos;m not a neuro@@ scientist .
I don &apos;t know even if there is something called a conditioned refle@@ x .
But it might be .
Because the people I speak to in the northern h@@ emis@@ p@@ here that used to go in the cinema get this .
And some of the people I speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don &apos;t get it in the same way .
Everybody likes it , but some like it more than others .
So this leads me to think of this in a different way .
We &apos;re not feeling it . We &apos;re thinking beauty is in the lim@@ bic system  if that &apos;s not an out@@ mo@@ ded idea .
These are the bits , the pleasure centers , and maybe what I &apos;m seeing and sen@@ sing and feeling is b@@ yp@@ ass@@ ing my thinking .
The wir@@ ing from your sen@@ sory apparatus to those bits is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the cor@@ tex .
They arrive first .
So how do we make that actually work ?
And how much of that re@@ active side of it is due to what we already know , or what we &apos;re going to learn , about something ?
This is one of the most beautiful things I know .
It &apos;s a plastic bag .
And when I looked at it first , I thought , no , there &apos;s no beauty in that .
Then I found out , post exposure , that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy pu@@ ddle or a stream filled with co@@ li@@ forms and all sorts of disgusting stuff , that that filthy water will mig@@ rate through the wall of the bag by o@@ smo@@ sis and end up inside it as pure , po@@ table drinking water .
And all of a sudden , this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me .
Now I &apos;m going to ask you again to switch on the emotional bit .
Would you mind taking the brain out , and I just want you to feel something .
Look at that . What are you feeling about it ?
Is it beautiful ? Is it exciting ?
I &apos;m watching your faces very carefully .
There &apos;s some rather bor@@ ed@@ @@ looking gentlemen and some slightly eng@@ age@@ d@@ looking ladies who are picking up something off that .
Maybe there &apos;s an inno@@ cence to it .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you what it is . Are you ready ?
This is the last act on this Earth of a little girl called Heidi , five years old , before she died of cancer to the sp@@ ine .
It &apos;s the last thing she did , the last physical act .
Look at that picture .
Look at the inno@@ cence . Look at the beauty in it .
Is it beautiful now ?
Stop . Stop . How do you feel ?
Where are you feeling this ?
I &apos;m feeling it here . I feel it here .
And I &apos;m watching your faces , because your faces are telling me something .
The lady over there is actually crying , by the way .
But what are you doing ?
I watch what people do .
I watch faces .
I watch reactions .
Because I have to know how people react to things .
And one of the most common faces on something faced with beauty , something stu@@ pe@@ f@@ y@@ ingly delicious , is what I call the OM@@ G .
And by the way , there &apos;s no pleasure in that face .
It &apos;s not a &quot; this is wonderful ! &quot;

The eye@@ bro@@ ws are doing this , the eyes are def@@ oc@@ used , and the mouth is hanging open .
That &apos;s not the expression of joy .
There &apos;s something else in that .
There &apos;s something weird happening .
So pleasure seems to be temper@@ ed by a whole series of different things coming in .
Po@@ ign@@ ancy is a word I love as a designer .
It means something trig@@ gering a big emotional response , often quite a sad emotional response , but it &apos;s part of what we do .
It isn &apos;t just about nice .
And this is the di@@ lemma , this is the para@@ dox , of beauty .
Sen@@ sor@@ ily , we &apos;re taking in all sorts of things  mix@@ tures of things that are good , bad , exciting , fri@@ ghtening  to come up with that sen@@ sor@@ ial exposure , that sens@@ ation of what &apos;s going on .
P@@ ath@@ os appears obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl &apos;s drawing .
And also tri@@ umph , this sense of trans@@ cen@@ dence , this &quot; I never knew that . Ah , this is something new . &quot;
And that &apos;s packed in there as well .
And as we assem@@ ble these tools , from a design point of view , I get terribly excited about it , because these are things , as we &apos;ve already said , they &apos;re arriving at the brain , it would seem , before co@@ gni@@ tion , before we can manipul@@ ate them  electro@@ chemical party tricks .
Now what I &apos;m also interested in is : Is it possible to separate in@@ trin@@ sic and ex@@ trin@@ sic beauty ?
By that , I mean in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally beautiful things , just something that &apos;s ex@@ quis@@ itely beautiful , that &apos;s univers@@ ally beautiful .
Very hard to find . Maybe you &apos;ve got some examples of it .
Very hard to find something that , to everybody , is a very beautiful thing , without a certain amount of information packed in there before .
So a lot of it tends to be ex@@ trin@@ sic .
It &apos;s medi@@ ated by information before the comprehen@@ sion .
Or the information &apos;s added on at the back , like that little girl &apos;s drawing that I showed you .
Now when talking about beauty you can &apos;t get away from the fact that a lot experiments have been done in this way with faces and what have you .
And one of the most te@@ di@@ ous ones , I think , was saying that beauty was about sy@@ mm@@ etry .
Well it obviously isn &apos;t .
This is a more interesting one where half faces were shown to some people , and then to add them into a list of most beautiful to least beautiful and then ex@@ posing a full face .
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence .
So it wasn &apos;t about sy@@ mm@@ etry .
In fact , this lady has a particularly asy@@ mmet@@ rical face , of which both sides are beautiful .
But they &apos;re both different .
And as a designer , I can &apos;t help me@@ dd@@ ling with this , so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as I go .
Now I can feel a sens@@ ation of delight and beauty if I look at that eye .
I &apos;m not getting it off the eye@@ bro@@ w .
And the ear@@ hole isn &apos;t doing it to me at all .
So I don &apos;t know how much this is helping me , but it &apos;s helping to guide me to the places where the signals are coming off .
And as I say , I &apos;m not a neuro@@ scientist , but to understand how I can start to assem@@ ble things that will very quickly b@@ ypass this thinking part and get me to the enjoyable pre@@ co@@ gni@@ tive elements .
An@@ ais N@@ in and the Tal@@ mud have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are , but as we are .
So I &apos;m going to sha@@ mel@@ essly expose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
And this is the F@@ 1 MV A@@ gu@@ sta .
Ah@@ h@@ hh .
It is really  I mean , I can &apos;t express to you how exquisite this object is .
But I also know why it &apos;s exquisite to me , because it &apos;s a pal@@ imp@@ s@@ est of things .
It &apos;s m@@ asses and m@@ asses of layers .
This is just the bit that pro@@ tru@@ des into our physical dimension .
It &apos;s something much bigger .
La@@ yer after layer of legend , sport , details that res@@ on@@ ate .
I mean , if I just go through some of them now  I know about lam@@ in@@ ar flow when it comes to air@@ @@ pier@@ cing objects , and that does it consu@@ mm@@ ately well , you can see it can .
So that &apos;s getting me excited .
And I feel that here .
This bit , the big secret of automotive design  reflection management .
It &apos;s not about the shapes , it &apos;s how the shapes reflect light .
Now that thing , light fli@@ ckers across it as you move , so it becomes a k@@ ine@@ tic object , even though it &apos;s standing still  managed by how bri@@ lli@@ antly that &apos;s done on the reflection .
This little relief on the foot@@ plate , by the way , to a rider means there &apos;s something going on underneath it  in this case , a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably , taking the power from the engine .
I &apos;m getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes f@@ lick across these things .
Tit@@ anium l@@ acqu@@ er on this .
I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
That &apos;s how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel .
I &apos;m really getting into this now .
And of course , a racing bike doesn &apos;t have a pro@@ p stand , but this one , because it &apos;s a road bike , it all goes away and it fol@@ ds into this little gap .
So it dis@@ appears .
And then I can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
Why would you do that ?
Because I know we need to bring the wheel far@@ ther into the aer@@ od@@ y@@ nam@@ ics .
So it &apos;s more expensive , but it &apos;s wonderful .
And to cap it all , brand roy@@ alty  A@@ gu@@ sta , Count A@@ gu@@ sta , from the great histor@@ ies of this stuff .
The bit that you can &apos;t see is the genius that created this .
Mas@@ simo Tam@@ bur@@ ini .
They call him &quot; The Pl@@ um@@ ber &quot; in Italy , as well as &quot; Maestro , &quot; because he actually is engineer and cra@@ fts@@ man and sculp@@ tor at the same time .
There &apos;s so little compromise on this , you can &apos;t see it .
But unfortunately , the likes of me and people that are like me have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty .
We have to deal with it .
So I have to work with a supply chain , and I &apos;ve got to work with the technologies , and I &apos;ve got to work with everything else all the time , and so compromises start to fit into it .
And so look at her .
I &apos;ve had to make a bit of a compromise there .
I &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a milli@@ meter .
No one &apos;s noticed , have they yet ?
Did you see what I did ?
I moved three things by a milli@@ meter .
Pretty ? Yes .
Beautiful ? Maybe less@@ er .
But then , of course , the consumer says that doesn &apos;t really matter .
So that &apos;s okay , isn &apos;t it ?
Another milli@@ meter ?
No one &apos;s going to notice those split lines and changes .
It &apos;s that easy to lose beauty , because beauty &apos;s incredibly difficult to do .
And only a few people can do it .
And a focus group cannot do it .
And a team rarely can do it .
It takes a central cor@@ tex , if you like , to be able to or@@ ches@@ trate all those elements at the same time .
This is a beautiful water bottle  some of you know of it  done by Ross Lo@@ ve@@ gro@@ ve , the designer .
This is pretty close to in@@ trin@@ sic beauty . This one , as long as you know what water is like then you can experience this .
It &apos;s lovely because it is an em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of something refreshing and delicious .
I might like it more than you like it , because I know how bloody hard it is to do it .
It &apos;s stu@@ pe@@ f@@ y@@ ingly difficult to make something that refra@@ cts light like that , that comes out of the tool correctly , that goes down the line without falling over .
Under@@ neath this , like the story of the s@@ wan , is a million things very difficult to do .
So all hail to that .
It &apos;s a fantastic example , a simple object .
And the one I showed you before was , of course , a mas@@ sively complex one .
And they &apos;re working in beauty in slightly different ways because of it .
You all , I guess , like me , enjoy watching a bal@@ let dancer dance .
And part of the joy of it is , you know the difficulty .

You also may be taking into account the fact that it &apos;s incredibly painful .
Anybody seen a bal@@ let dancer &apos;s toes when they come out of the points ?
While she &apos;s doing these gra@@ ceful arab@@ es@@ ques and p@@ lies and what have you , something horrible &apos;s going on down here .
The comprehen@@ sion of it leads us to a greater and hei@@ ghtened sense of the beauty of what &apos;s actually going on .
Now I &apos;m using micro@@ seconds wron@@ gly here , so please ignore me .
But what I have to do now , feeling again , what I &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enz@@ y@@ mes , of these trig@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
So we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
Right , are you ready ? I &apos;m going to show you something for a very , very brief moment .
Are you ready ? Okay .
Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash ?
It &apos;s not .
Tell me something , did you think it was quick when you first saw it ? Yes you did .
Did you think it was modern ? Yes you did .
That bli@@ p , that information , shot into you before that .
And because your brain star@@ ter motor began there , now it &apos;s got to deal with it .
And the great thing is , this motorcycle has been sty@@ led this way specifically to en@@ gender a sense that it &apos;s green technology and it &apos;s good for you and it &apos;s light and it &apos;s all part of the future .
So is that wrong ?
Well in this case it isn &apos;t , because it &apos;s a very , very ec@@ ologi@@ call@@ y@@ sound piece of technology .
But you &apos;re a slave of that first flash .
We are slaves to the first few fra@@ ctions of a second  and that &apos;s where much of my work has to win or lose , on a shelf in a shop .
It wins or loses at that point .
You may see 50 , 100 , 200 things on a shelf as you walk down it , but I have to work within that domain , to ensure that it gets you there first .
And finally , the layer that I love , of knowledge .
Some of you , I &apos;m sure , will be familiar with this .
What &apos;s incredible about this , and the way I love to come back to it , is this is taking something that you hate or bor@@ es you , fol@@ ding clothes , and if you can actually do this  who can actually do this ? Anybody try to do this ?
Yeah ?
It &apos;s fantastic , isn &apos;t it ?
Look at that . Do you want to see it again ?
No time . It says I have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
But just go to the Web , YouTube , pull it down , &quot; fol@@ ding T@@ shirt . &quot;
That &apos;s how under@@ paid yo@@ ung@@ er@@ @@ aged people have to fold your T@@ shirt .
You didn &apos;t maybe know it .
But how do you feel about it ?
It feels fantastic when you do it , you look forward to doing it , and when you tell somebody else about it  like you probably have  you look really smart .
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside , the stuff that costs nothing , because that knowledge is free  bund@@ le that together and where do we come out ?
Form follows function ?
Only sometimes . Only sometimes .
Form is function . Form is function .
It inform@@ s , it tells us , it supplies us answers before we &apos;ve even thought about it .
And so I &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; form , &quot; and I &apos;ve stopped using words like &quot; function &quot; as a designer .
What I try to pursue now is the emotional functionality of things .
Because if I can get that right , I can make them wonderful , and I can make them repeatedly wonderful .
And you know what those products and services are , because you own some of them .
They &apos;re the things that you &apos;d s@@ nat@@ ch if the house was on fire .
For@@ ming the emotional bond between this thing and you is an electro@@ chemical party trick that happens before you even think about it .
Thank you very much .
Richard Se@@ ym@@ our : How beauty feels
A story , a work of art , a face , a designed object  how do we tell that something is beautiful ? And why does it matter so much to us ? Designer Richard Se@@ ym@@ our expl@@ ores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhi@@ bit it .
One of the most common ways of divi@@ ding the world is into those who believe and those who don &apos;t  into the religious and the ath@@ ei@@ sts .
And for the last decade or so , it &apos;s been quite clear what being an ath@@ eist means .
There have been some very vocal ath@@ ei@@ sts who &apos;ve pointed out , not just that religion is wrong , but that it &apos;s ridiculous .
These people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued  they &apos;ve argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fai@@ ries and essentially that the whole thing is a chil@@ dish game .
Now I think it &apos;s too easy .
I think it &apos;s too easy to dis@@ miss the whole of religion that way .
And it &apos;s as easy as shooting fish in a barrel .
And what I &apos;d like to inau@@ gur@@ ate today is a new way of being an ath@@ eist  if you like , a new version of ath@@ ei@@ sm we could call Ath@@ ei@@ sm 2.0 .
Now what is Ath@@ ei@@ sm 2.0 ?
Well it starts from a very basic pre@@ mise : of course , there &apos;s no God .
Of course , there are no dei@@ ties or super@@ natural spirits or angels , etc .
Now let &apos;s move on ; that &apos;s not the end of the story , that &apos;s the very , very beginning .
I &apos;m interested in the kind of constitu@@ ency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , &quot; I can &apos;t believe in any of this stuff .
I can &apos;t believe in the doc@@ tr@@ ines .
I don &apos;t think these doc@@ tr@@ ines are right .
But , &quot; a very important but , &quot; I love Christmas car@@ ols .
I really like the art of Man@@ te@@ gna .
I really like looking at old churches .
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament . &quot;
Whatever it may be , you know the kind of thing I &apos;m talking about  people who are attracted to the ritu@@ alistic side , the mor@@ alistic , commun@@ al side of religion , but can &apos;t bear the doc@@ tr@@ ine .
Until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
It &apos;s almost as though either you accept the doc@@ tr@@ ine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doc@@ tr@@ ine and you &apos;re living in some kind of spiritual wa@@ st@@ eland under the guidance of CN@@ N and Wal@@ mar@@ t .
So that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
I don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
I think there is an alternative .
I think there are ways  and I &apos;m being both very respec@@ tful and completely im@@ pi@@ ous  of stealing from religi@@ ons .
If you don &apos;t believe in a religion , there &apos;s nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
And for me , ath@@ ei@@ sm 2.0 is about both , as I say , a respec@@ tful and an im@@ pi@@ ous way of going through religi@@ ons and saying , &quot; What here could we use ? &quot;
The sec@@ ular world is full of holes .
We have sec@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed badly , I would argue .
And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of in@@ sights into areas of life that are not going too well .
And I &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
Now education is a field the sec@@ ular world really believes in .
When we think about how we &apos;re going to make the world a better place , we think education ; that &apos;s where we put a lot of money .
Education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it &apos;s also going to make us better people .
You know the kind of thing a comm@@ en@@ cement address is , and gradu@@ ation cerem@@ onies , those ly@@ rical claims that education , the process of education  particularly higher education  will make us into no@@ bler and better human beings .
That &apos;s a lovely idea .
Interesting where it came from .
In the early 19th century , church attend@@ ance in Western Europe started sli@@ ding down very , very sharp@@ ly , and people pani@@ cked .
They asked themselves the following question .
They said , where are people going to find the mor@@ ality , where are they going to find guidance , and where are they going to find sources of con@@ sol@@ ation ?
And influ@@ ential voices came up with one answer .
They said culture .
It &apos;s to culture that we should look for guidance , for con@@ sol@@ ation , for mor@@ ality .
Let &apos;s look to the plays of Shakespeare , the di@@ alo@@ gues of Pla@@ to , the no@@ vels of Jane Au@@ sten .
In there , we &apos;ll find a lot of the tru@@ ths that we might previously have found in the Go@@ sp@@ el of Saint John .
Now I think that &apos;s a very beautiful idea and a very true idea .
They wanted to replace scrip@@ ture with culture .
And that &apos;s a very plau@@ sible idea .
It &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
If you went to a top university  let &apos;s say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge  and you said , &quot; I &apos;ve come here because I &apos;m in search of mor@@ ality , guidance and con@@ sol@@ ation ; I want to know how to live , &quot; they would show you the way to the insane asylum .

This is simply not what our grand@@ est and best in@@ stitutes of higher learning are in the business of .
Why ? They don &apos;t think we need it .
They don &apos;t think we are in an urgent need of assistance .
They see us as adults , rational adults .
What we need is information .
We need data , we don &apos;t need help .
Now religi@@ ons start from a very different place indeed .
All religi@@ ons , all major religi@@ ons , at various points call us children .
And like children , they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .
We &apos;re only just holding it together .
Perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
But anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
And we need help . Of course , we need help .
And so we need guidance and we need di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic learning .
You know , in the 18th century in the U.@@ K. , the greatest pre@@ acher , greatest religious pre@@ acher , was a man called John Wesley , who went up and down this country delivering ser@@ m@@ ons , advis@@ ing people how they could live .
He delivered ser@@ m@@ ons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents , the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich .
He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of ser@@ m@@ ons , the classic medium of delivery of religi@@ ons .
Now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of ser@@ m@@ ons .
If you said to a modern liberal individu@@ alist , &quot; Hey , how about a ser@@ mon ? &quot;
they &apos;d go , &quot; No , no . I don &apos;t need one of those .
I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
What &apos;s the difference between a ser@@ mon and our modern , sec@@ ular mode of delivery , the lecture ?
Well a ser@@ mon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
And I think we need to get back to that ser@@ mon tradition .
The tradition of ser@@ mon@@ izing is hu@@ gely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , mor@@ ality and con@@ sol@@ ation  and religi@@ ons know that .
Another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern sec@@ ular world that if you tell someone something once , they &apos;ll remember it .
Sit them in a class@@ room , tell them about Pla@@ to at the age of 20 , send them out for a career in management consult@@ ancy for 40 years , and that lesson will stick with them .
Religi@@ ons go , &quot; Nonsense .
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
So get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
That &apos;s what all religi@@ ons tell us : &quot; Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
Otherwise our minds are like sie@@ ves .
So religi@@ ons are cultures of re@@ petition .
They circle the great tru@@ ths again and again and again .
We associate re@@ petition with bor@@ e@@ dom .
&quot; Give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
&quot; The new is better than the old . &quot;
If I said to you , &quot; Okay , we &apos;re not going to have new TED .
We &apos;re just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they &apos;re so true .
We &apos;re going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times because what she says is so clever , &quot; you &apos;d feel cheated .
Not so if you &apos;re adopting a religious min@@ d@@ set .
The other things that religi@@ ons do is to arrange time .
All the major religi@@ ons give us cal@@ end@@ ars .
What is a calendar ?
A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas .
In the Catholic chron@@ ology , Catholic calendar , at the end of March you will think about St. Jer@@ ome and his qualities of humili@@ ty and goodness and his gener@@ osity to the poor .
You won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
Now we don &apos;t think that way .
In the sec@@ ular world we think , &quot; If an idea is important , I &apos;ll bump into it .
I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
Nonsense , says the religious world view .
Religi@@ ous view says we need cal@@ end@@ ars , we need to structure time , we need to synchron@@ ize encoun@@ ters .
This comes across also in the way in which religi@@ ons set up ritu@@ als around important feelings .
Take the Moon . It &apos;s really important to look at the Moon .
You know , when you look at the Moon , you think , &quot; I &apos;m really small . What are my problems ? &quot;
It sets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often . We don &apos;t .
Why don &apos;t we ? Well there &apos;s nothing to tell us , &quot; Look at the Moon . &quot;
But if you &apos;re a Z@@ en Budd@@ h@@ ist in the middle of September , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a can@@ on@@ ical platform and made to celebrate the festival of T@@ su@@ k@@ im@@ i , where you will be given po@@ ems to read in honor of the Moon and the passage of time and the fra@@ il@@ ty of life that it should remind us of .
You &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
That &apos;s very good .
The other thing that religi@@ ons are really aware of is : speak well  I &apos;m not doing a very good job of this here  but or@@ atory , or@@ atory is absolutely key to religi@@ ons .
In the sec@@ ular world , you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .
But the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
What you &apos;re saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .
So if you go to an African American Pent@@ ec@@ ost@@ alist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
After every convincing point , people will go , &quot; Amen , amen , amen . &quot;
At the end of a really r@@ ous@@ ing paragraph , they &apos;ll all stand up , and they &apos;ll go , &quot; Thank you Jesus , thank you Christ , thank you Sa@@ vi@@ or . &quot;
If we were doing it like they do it  let &apos;s not do it , but if we were to do it  I would tell you something like , &quot; Culture should replace scrip@@ ture . &quot;
And you would go , &quot; Amen , amen , amen . &quot;
And at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; Thank you Pla@@ to , thank you Shakespeare , thank you Jane Au@@ sten . &quot;
And we &apos;d know that we had a real rhythm going .
All right , all right . We &apos;re getting there . We &apos;re getting there .
The other thing that religi@@ ons know is we &apos;re not just brains , we are also bodies .
And when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
So for example , take the Jewish idea of forgiveness .
Jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start ane@@ w and start af@@ res@@ h .
They don &apos;t just deliver us ser@@ m@@ ons on this .
They don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
They tell us to have a bath .
So in Or@@ tho@@ dox Jewish communities , every Friday you go to a Mik@@ ve@@ h .
You immer@@ se yourself in the water , and a physical action backs up a philosophi@@ cal idea .
We don &apos;t tend to do that .
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
Religi@@ ons are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
Let &apos;s look at art now .
Now art is something that in the sec@@ ular world , we think very highly of . We think art is really , really important .
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums , etc .
We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new ca@@ thedr@@ als , or our new churches .
You &apos;ve heard that saying .
Now I think that the potential is there , but we &apos;ve completely let ourselves down .
And the reason we &apos;ve let ourselves down is that we &apos;re not properly studying how religi@@ ons handle art .
The two really bad ideas that are ho@@ vering in the modern world that in@@ hi@@ bit our capacity to draw strength from art : The first idea is that art should be for art &apos;s sake  a ridiculous idea  an idea that art should live in a her@@ me@@ tic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world .
I couldn &apos;t disagree more .
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
That &apos;s why a very common feeling when you &apos;re in a museum  let &apos;s admit it  is , &quot; I don &apos;t know what this is about . &quot;
But if we &apos;re serious people , we don &apos;t admit to that .
But that feeling of pu@@ zz@@ lement is structural to contemporary art .
Now religi@@ ons have a much san@@ er attitude to art .

They have no trouble telling us what art is about .
Art is about two things in all the major fai@@ ths .
Firstly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to love .
And secondly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
And that &apos;s what art is .
Art is a vis@@ cer@@ al encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
So as you walk around a church , or a mos@@ que or a cathedral , what you &apos;re trying to im@@ bi@@ be , what you &apos;re im@@ bi@@ bing is , through your eyes , through your senses , tru@@ ths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
Essen@@ ti@@ ally it &apos;s propaganda .
Rem@@ br@@ andt is a propag@@ and@@ ist in the Christian view .
Now the word &quot; propaganda &quot; sets off alarm bells .
We think of Hitler , we think of Stalin . Don &apos;t , necessarily .
Propag@@ anda is a manner of being di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic in honor of something .
And if that thing is good , there &apos;s no problem with it at all .
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religi@@ ons .
And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum  if I was a museum cur@@ ator , I would make a room for love , a room for gener@@ osity .
All works of art are talking to us about things .
And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we &apos;ve neglected because of certain mis@@ @@ founded ideas .
Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
Art should be di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic .
Let &apos;s think of something else .
The people in the modern world , in the sec@@ ular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher s@@ oul@@ @@ like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
They &apos;re po@@ ets , they &apos;re philosoph@@ ers , they &apos;re photograph@@ ers , they &apos;re film@@ makers .
And they tend to be on their own .
They &apos;re our cottage industries . They are vulnerable , single people .
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
And they don &apos;t really change much .
Now think about religi@@ ons , think about organized religi@@ ons .
What do organized religi@@ ons do ?
They group together , they form institutions .
And that has all sorts of advantages .
First of all , scale , might .
The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the Wall Street Journal .
These are massive machines .
They &apos;re collabor@@ ative , they &apos;re br@@ anded , they &apos;re multinational , and they &apos;re highly discipl@@ ined .
These are all very good qualities .
We recognize them in relation to corporations .
And corporations are very like religi@@ ons in many ways , except they &apos;re right down at the bottom of the py@@ ra@@ mid of needs .
They &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff  the therap@@ ists , the po@@ ets  are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
So religi@@ ons are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
Now we may not agree with what religi@@ ons are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
Books alone , books written by l@@ one individuals , are not going to change anything .
We need to group together .
If you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collabor@@ ative .
And that &apos;s what religi@@ ons do .
They are multinational , as I say , they are br@@ anded , they have a clear identity , so they don &apos;t get lost in a busy world .
That &apos;s something we can learn from .
I want to conclude .
Really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields , there is something to learn from the example of religion  even if you don &apos;t believe any of it .
If you &apos;re involved in anything that &apos;s commun@@ al , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
If you &apos;re involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pil@@ gri@@ mage .
Look very closely at pil@@ gri@@ mage .
We haven &apos;t begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven &apos;t looked at what religi@@ ons do with travel .
If you &apos;re in the art world , look at the example of what religi@@ ons are doing with art .
And if you &apos;re an educ@@ ator in any way , again , look at how religi@@ ons are spreading ideas .
You may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they &apos;re highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
So really my conclu@@ ding point is you may not agree with religion , but at the end of the day , religi@@ ons are so subtle , so complicated , so intelligent in many ways that they &apos;re not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone ; they &apos;re for all of us .
Thank you very much .
Now this is actually a coura@@ geous talk , because you &apos;re kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridicul@@ ed in some quarters .
You can get shot by both sides .
You can get shot by the hard@@ @@ headed ath@@ ei@@ sts , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
In@@ coming missiles from North Oxford at any moment .
Indeed .
But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense  that &apos;s actually probably the most important thing to anyone who &apos;s religious  of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that &apos;s bigger than you are .
Is there any room for that experience in Ath@@ ei@@ sm 2.0 ?
Absolutely . I , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; But isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Of course . &quot; And they say , &quot; So aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
And I go , &quot; No . &quot; Why does that sense of mystery , that sense of the di@@ zz@@ ying scale of the universe , need to be accompanied by a mysti@@ cal feeling ?
Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it , so I don &apos;t feel the need .
The universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious super@@ structure .
So one can have so@@ @@ called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit .
Actually , let me just ask a question .
How many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
Is there an equivalent process by which there &apos;s a sort of bridge between what you &apos;re talking about and what you would say to them ?
I would say that there are many , many gaps in sec@@ ular life and these can be plu@@ gged .
It &apos;s not as though , as I try to suggest , it &apos;s not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you don &apos;t have religion and then you &apos;re cut off from all these very good things .
It &apos;s so sad that we constantly say , &quot; I don &apos;t believe so I can &apos;t have community , so I &apos;m cut off from mor@@ ality , so I can &apos;t go on a pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot;
One wants to say , &quot; Nonsense . Why not ? &quot;
And that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
There &apos;s so much we can absor@@ b .
Ath@@ ei@@ sm shouldn &apos;t cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
It seems to me that there &apos;s plenty of people in the TED community who are ath@@ ei@@ sts .
But probably most people in the community certainly don &apos;t think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
Are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great r@@ all@@ ying cry of divide and war , that there could be bri@@ dging ?
No , we need to be polite about differences .
Poli@@ ten@@ ess is a mu@@ ch@@ @@ over@@ looked virtue .
It &apos;s seen as hypo@@ cris@@ y .
But we need to get to a stage when you &apos;re an ath@@ eist and someone says , &quot; Well you know , I did pray the other day , &quot; you poli@@ tely ignore it .
You move on .
Because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli@@ tely differ .
And I think that &apos;s what the religious wars of late have ignored .
They &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmon@@ ious dis@@ agreement .
And finally , does this new thing that you &apos;re proposing that &apos;s not a religion but something else , does it need a leader , and are you volunte@@ ering to be the pop@@ e ?
Well , one thing that we &apos;re all very suspicious of is individual leaders .
It doesn &apos;t need it .
What I &apos;ve tried to lay out is a framework and I &apos;m hoping that people can just fill it in .
I &apos;ve sk@@ et@@ ched a sort of broad framework .
But wherever you are , as I say , if you &apos;re in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
If you &apos;re in the commun@@ al industry , look at religion and do the commun@@ al bit .

So it &apos;s a wi@@ ki project .
A@@ lain , thank you for spar@@ king many conversations later .
A@@ lain de Bot@@ ton : Ath@@ ei@@ sm 2.0
What aspects of religion should ath@@ ei@@ sts adopt ? A@@ lain de Bot@@ ton suggests a &quot; religion for ath@@ ei@@ sts &quot;  call it Ath@@ ei@@ sm 2.0  that incorpor@@ ates religious forms and traditions to satisfy our human need for connection , ritual and trans@@ cen@@ dence .
I would like to talk today about what I think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embar@@ ked upon , which is the quest to understand the universe and our place in it .
My own interest in this subject , and my passion for it , began rather accidentally .
I had bought a copy of this book , &quot; The Uni@@ verse and Dr. Einstein &quot;  a used paper@@ back from a secon@@ d@@ hand book@@ store in Seattle .
A few years after that , in Ban@@ gal@@ ore , I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night , and I picked up this book , thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes .
And as it happened , I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot .
And I was left with this intense feeling of a@@ we and ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ation at the universe and our own ability to understand as much as we do .
And that feeling hasn &apos;t left me yet .
That feeling was the trigger for me to actually change my career  from being a software engineer to become a science writer  so that I could par@@ take in the joy of science , and also the joy of communic@@ ating it to others .
And that feeling also led me to a pil@@ gri@@ mage of sorts , to go literally to the ends of the earth to see tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , det@@ ec@@ tors , instruments that people are building , or have built , in order to probe the co@@ smo@@ s in greater and greater detail .
So it took me from places like Chile  the At@@ ac@@ ama Des@@ ert in Chile  to Si@@ ber@@ ia , to underground mines in the Japanese Alps , in Northern America , all the way to Ant@@ arc@@ tica and even to the South Pole .
And today I would like to share with you some images , some stories of these trips .
I have been basically spending the last few years docum@@ enting the efforts of some extremely in@@ tre@@ p@@ id men and women who are putting , literally at times , their lives at stake working in some very remote and very hostile places so that they may gather the fa@@ in@@ test signals from the co@@ smo@@ s in order for us to understand this universe .
And I first begin with a pie chart  and I promise this is the only pie chart in the whole presentation  but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the co@@ smo@@ s .
All the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter  the stuff that we &apos;re all made of  and that &apos;s four percent of the universe .
A@@ stronom@@ ers and co@@ sm@@ ologists and physi@@ c@@ ists think that there is something called dark matter in the universe , which makes up 23 percent of the universe , and something called dark energy , which per@@ me@@ ates the fabric of spac@@ e@@ time , that makes up another 73 percent .
So if you look at this pie chart , 96 percent of the universe , at this point in our expl@@ oration of it , is unknown or not well understood .
And most of the experiments , tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es that I went to see are in some way addressing this question , these two twin myst@@ eries of dark matter and dark energy .
I will take you first to an underground mine in Northern Minn@@ es@@ ota where people are looking for something called dark matter .
And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign of a dark matter par@@ ticle hitting one of their det@@ ec@@ tors .
And the reason why they have to go underground is that , if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth , the same experiment would be sw@@ amp@@ ed by signals that could be created by things like co@@ s@@ mic rays , ambi@@ ent radio activity , even our own bodies . You might not believe it , but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment .
So they go deep inside mines to find a kind of environmental silence that will allow them to hear the ping of a dark matter par@@ ticle hitting their det@@ ector .
And I went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually  you can barely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s entirely dark in there  this is a ca@@ vern that was left behind by the min@@ ers who left this mine in 1960 .
And physi@@ c@@ ists came and started using it sometime in the 1980s .
And the min@@ ers in the early part of the last century worked , literally , in cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght .
And today , you would see this inside the mine , half a mile underground .
This is one of the largest underground lab@@ s in the world .
And , among other things , they &apos;re looking for dark matter .
There is another way to search for dark matter , which is indirectly .
If dark matter exists in our universe , in our galaxy , then these particles should be sm@@ as@@ hing together and producing other particles that we know about  one of them being neut@@ rin@@ os .
And neut@@ rin@@ os you can detect by the signature they leave when they hit water molec@@ ules .
When a neut@@ rin@@ o hits a water molec@@ ule it em@@ its a kind of blue light , a flash of blue light , and by looking for this blue light , you can essentially understand something about the neut@@ rin@@ o and then , indirectly , something about the dark matter that might have created this neut@@ rin@@ o .
But you need very , very large volumes of water in order to do this .
You need something like tens of me@@ g@@ at@@ ons of water  almost a gi@@ g@@ aton of water  in order to have any chance of catching this neut@@ rin@@ o .
And where in the world would you find such water ?
Well the Russians have a tank in their own back@@ yard .
This is Lake Ba@@ ik@@ al .
It is the largest lake in the world . It &apos;s 800 km long .
It &apos;s about 40 to 50 km wide in most places , and one to two kilometers deep .
And what the Russians are doing is they &apos;re building these det@@ ec@@ tors and immer@@ sing them about a kilom@@ eter beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flas@@ hes of blue light .
And this is the scene that gre@@ eted me when I landed there .
This is Lake Ba@@ ik@@ al in the peak of the Si@@ ber@@ ian winter .
The lake is entirely frozen .
And the line of black d@@ ots that you see in the background , that &apos;s the ice camp where the physi@@ c@@ ists are working .
The reason why they have to work in winter is because they don &apos;t have the money to work in summer and spring , which , if they did that , they would need ships and sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles to do their work .
So they wait until winter  the lake is completely frozen over  and they use this met@@ er@@ @@ thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work .
So this is the Russians working on the ice in the peak of the Si@@ ber@@ ian winter .
They have to drill holes in the ice , dive down into the water  cold , cold water  to get hold of the instrument , bring it up , do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do , put it back and get out before the ice mel@@ ts .
Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months and it &apos;s full of cra@@ cks .
And you have to imagine , there &apos;s an entire se@@ a@@ like lake underneath , moving .
I still don &apos;t understand this one Russian man working in his bare chest , but that tells you how hard he was working .
And these people , a handful of people , have been working for 20 years , looking for particles that may or may not exist .
And they have dedicated their lives to it .
And just to give you an idea , they have spent 20 million over 20 years .
It &apos;s very harsh conditions .
They work on a sho@@ estr@@ ing budget .
The toi@@ lets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a wooden sha@@ ck .
And it &apos;s that basic , but they do this every year .
From Si@@ ber@@ ia to the At@@ ac@@ ama Des@@ ert in Chile , to see something called The Very Large Tel@@ esc@@ ope .
The Very Large Tel@@ esc@@ ope is one of these things that astronom@@ ers do  they name their tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es rather uni@@ mag@@ in@@ atively .
I can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re planning is called The Ex@@ trem@@ ely Large Tel@@ esc@@ ope .
And you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but the one after that is going to be called The Over@@ whel@@ m@@ ingly Large Tel@@ esc@@ ope .
But nonetheless , it &apos;s an extraordinary piece of engineering .
These are four 8.@@ 2 meter tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
And these tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , among other things , they &apos;re being used to study how the expansion of the universe is changing with time .
And the more you understand that , the better you would understand what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about .
And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with as regards this tel@@ esc@@ ope is the mirror .
Each mirror , there are four of them , is made of a single piece of glass , a mon@@ oli@@ th@@ ic piece of high@@ @@ tech ceram@@ ic , that has been ground down and polis@@ hed to such accuracy that the only way to understand what that is is &#91; to &#93; imagine a city like Paris , with all its buildings and the Ei@@ ffel Tower , if you gr@@ ind down Paris to that kind of accuracy , you would be left with b@@ umps that are one milli@@ meter high .
And that &apos;s the kind of polis@@ hing that these mirrors have en@@ du@@ red .
An extraordinary set of tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es .
Here &apos;s another view of the same .
The reason why you have to build these tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es in places like the At@@ ac@@ ama Des@@ ert is because of the high altitude desert .
The dry air is really good for tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , and also , the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains so that the tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es have about 300 days of clear skies .
Finally , I want to take you to Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world .
This is co@@ sm@@ ology &apos;s final frontier .
Some of the most amazing experiments , some of the most extreme experiments , are being done in Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
I was there to view something called a long@@ @@ duration balloon flight , which basically takes tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and instruments all the way to the upper atmosphere , the upper str@@ ato@@ sphere , 40 km up .
And that &apos;s where they do their experiments , and then the balloon , the pay@@ load , is brought down .
So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shel@@ f in Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
That &apos;s an American C@@ 17 cargo plane that flew us from New Zealand to Mc@@ Mur@@ do in Ant@@ arc@@ tica .
And here we are about to board our bus .
And I don &apos;t know if you can read the let@@ tering , but it says , &quot; Ivan the Terri@@ bus . &quot;
And that &apos;s taking us to Mc@@ Mur@@ do .
And this is the scene that gre@@ ets you in Mc@@ Mur@@ do .
And you barely might be able to make out this hut here .
This hut was built by Robert Fal@@ con Scott and his men when they first came to Ant@@ arc@@ tica on their first expedition to go to the South Pole .
Because it &apos;s so cold , the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it , with the rem@@ n@@ ants of the last meal they cooked still there .
It &apos;s an extraordinary place .
This is Mc@@ Mur@@ do itself . About a thousand people work here in summer , and about 200 in winter when it &apos;s completely dark for six months .
I was here to see the launch of this particular type of instrument .
This is a co@@ s@@ mic ray experiment that has been launched all the way to the up@@ per@@ @@ str@@ ato@@ sphere to an altitude of 40 km .
What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight .
So you &apos;re using a balloon to carry something that is two tons all the way to an altitude of 40 km .
And the engineers , the techni@@ cians , the physi@@ c@@ ists have all got to assem@@ ble on the Ross Ice Shel@@ f , because Ant@@ arc@@ tica  I won &apos;t go into the reasons why  but it &apos;s one of the most favor@@ able places for doing these balloon laun@@ ches , except for the weather .
The weather , as you can imagine , this is summer , and you &apos;re standing on 200 ft of ice .
And there &apos;s a volcan@@ o behind , which has gl@@ aci@@ ers at the very top .
have proceeded 1900 lines.
Total Results: 4613+ hits
And what they have to do is they have to assem@@ ble the entire balloon  the fabric , par@@ ach@@ ute and everything  on the ice and then fill it up with hel@@ ium .
And that process takes about two hours .
And the weather can change as they &apos;re putting together this whole assembly .
For instance , here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind , which is eventually going to be filled up with hel@@ ium .
Those two trucks you see at the very end carry 12 tanks each of comp@@ ressed hel@@ ium .
Now , in case the weather changes before the launch , they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes and take it out back to Mc@@ Mur@@ do Station .
And this particular balloon , because it has to launch two tons of weight , is an extremely huge balloon .
The fabric alone wei@@ ghs two tons .
In order to minim@@ ize the weight , it &apos;s very thin , it &apos;s as thin as a sandwich wra@@ pper .
And if they have to pack it back , they have to put it into boxes and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again  except , when they did it first , it would have been done in Texas .
Here , they can &apos;t do it with the kind shoes they &apos;re wearing , so they have to take their shoes off , get bar@@ ef@@ oot into the boxes , in this cold , and do that kind of work .
That &apos;s the kind of dedication these people have .
Here &apos;s the balloon being filled up with hel@@ ium , and you can see it &apos;s a gorgeous sight .
Here &apos;s a scene that shows you the balloon and the pay@@ load end@@ @@ to@@ @@ end .
So the balloon is being filled up with hel@@ ium on the le@@ ft@@ @@ hand side , and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle where there &apos;s a piece of electronics and explosives being connected to a par@@ ach@@ ute , and then the par@@ ach@@ ute is then connected to the pay@@ load .
And remember , all this wir@@ ing is being done by people in extreme cold , in sub@@ @@ zero temperatures .
They &apos;re wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff , but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that .
And I would like to share with you a launch .
Radio : Okay , release the balloon , release the balloon , release the balloon .
An@@ il An@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ amy : And I &apos;ll finally like to leave you with two images .
This is an observ@@ atory in the Him@@ al@@ ay@@ as , in Lad@@ ak@@ h in India .
And the thing I want you to look at here is the tel@@ esc@@ ope on the right@@ @@ hand side .
And on the far left there is a 400 year@@ @@ old Budd@@ h@@ ist monastery .
This is a clo@@ se@@ up of the Budd@@ h@@ ist monastery .
And I was struck by the ju@@ x@@ ta@@ position of these two enormous discipl@@ ines that humanity has .
One is exploring the co@@ smo@@ s on the outside , and the other one is exploring our interior being .
And both require silence of some sort .
And what struck me was every place that I went to to see these tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es , the astronom@@ ers and co@@ sm@@ ologists are in search of a certain kind of silence , whether it &apos;s silence from radio pollution or light pollution or whatever .
And it was very obvious that , if we destroy these silent places on Earth , we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look out@@ wards , because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space .
Thank you .
An@@ il An@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ amy : What it takes to do extreme astrop@@ hysi@@ cs
All over the planet , giant tel@@ es@@ cop@@ es and det@@ ec@@ tors are looking for clu@@ es to the work@@ ings of the universe . At the INK Conference , science writer An@@ il An@@ anth@@ as@@ w@@ amy tours us around these amazing installations , taking us to some of the most remote and silent places on Earth .
We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children .
If we don &apos;t do that , we &apos;re going to get the generation we deserve .
They &apos;re going to learn from whatever it is they have around them .
And we , as now the elite , parents , libr@@ arians , professionals , whatever it is , a bunch of our activities are , in fact , in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us , or as broadly as we can .
I &apos;m going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are car@@ ved in stone .
One is what &apos;s on the Boston Public Library .
Car@@ ved above their door is , &quot; Free to All . &quot;
It &apos;s kind of an inspir@@ ing statement , and I &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
I &apos;m a libr@@ arian , and what I &apos;m trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it .
And the idea of using technology is perfect for us .
I think we have the opportunity to on@@ e@@ up the Gre@@ eks .
It &apos;s not easy to on@@ e@@ up the Gre@@ eks . But with the industri@@ ousness of the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans , they were able to build the Library of Alexand@@ ria  the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world .
The problem was you actually had to go to Alexand@@ ria to go to it .
On the other hand , if you did , then great things happened .
I think we can on@@ e@@ up the Gre@@ eks and achieve something .
And I &apos;m going to try to argue only one point today : that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp .
So if I &apos;m successful , then you &apos;ll actually come away thinking , yeah , we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published , everything that was ever meant for distribution , available to anybody in the world that &apos;s ever wanted to have access to it .
Yes , there &apos;s issues about how money should be distributed , and that &apos;s still being re@@ figured out .
But I &apos;d say there &apos;s plenty of money , and there &apos;s plenty of demand , so we can actually achieve that .
But I &apos;m going to go over the technological , social and sort of where are we as a whole , trying to get to that particular vision .
And the way I &apos;m going to try to do this is do it like the Ama@@ zon@@ .com website , the books , music , video and just go step  media type by media type , just go and say , all right , how &apos;re we doing on this ?
So if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
Well , first you have to , as an engineer , scope the problem . How big is it ?
If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
Well , we don &apos;t really know , but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress . It &apos;s 26 million volumes , 26 million volumes .
It is , by far and away , the largest print library in the world .
And a book , if you had a book , is about a me@@ gab@@ y@@ te , so  you know , if you had it in Microsoft Word .
So a me@@ gab@@ y@@ te , 26 million me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes is 26 ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes  it goes me@@ ga@@  , gi@@ ga@@  , ter@@ a . 26 ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes .
26 ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes fits in a computer system that &apos;s about this big , on spinning Linux drives , and it costs about 6@@ 0,000 dollars .
So for the cost of a house  or around here , a garage  you can put , you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress .
That &apos;s pretty neat .
Then the question is , what do you get ?
You know , is it worth trying to get there ?
Do you actually want it online ?
Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books , and that &apos;s kind of fun .
And you can download these things , and look around them in new and different ways .
And you can get at them remot@@ ely , if you happen to have a laptop .
There &apos;s starting to be some of these sort of page turn@@ @@ y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways , and you can search them , make little tab@@ s , and it &apos;s kind of cute  still very book@@ @@ like  on your laptop .
But I don &apos;t know , reading things on a laptop  whenever I pull up my laptop , it always feels like work .
I think that &apos;s one of the reasons why the Kind@@ le is so great .
I don &apos;t have to feel like I &apos;m at work to read a Kind@@ le .
It &apos;s starting to be a little bit more specified .
But I have to say that there &apos;s older technologies that I tend to like .
I like the physical book .
And I think we can go and use our technology to go and di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze things , put them on the Net , and then download , print them and b@@ ind them , and end up with books again .
And we sort of said , well , how hard is this ?
And it turns out to not be very hard .
We actually went off to make a book@@ mobile .
And a book@@ mobile  the size of a van with a satellite dish , a printer , bin@@ der and c@@ utter , and kids make their own books .
It costs about three dollars to download , print and b@@ ind a normal , old book .
And they actually come out kind of nice looking .
You can actually get really goo@@ d@@ looking books for on the order of one penny per page , sort of the parts cost for doing this .
So the idea of  this technology actually may end up putting books back in people &apos;s hands again .
There are some other book@@ mobil@@ es running around .
This is Eric El@@ dred making books at Wal@@ den P@@ ond  Thor@@ eau &apos;s works .
This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services , for competing with the book@@ store there .
In India , they &apos;ve got another couple book@@ mobil@@ es running around .
And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexand@@ ria , the new Library of Alexand@@ ria , in Egypt .
It was quite pop@@ ularly attended .
And kids starting to make their own books , and a happy kid with the first book that he &apos;s ever owned .
So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little re@@ tro , but I think it still has its place .
And being from the Sili@@ con Valley , sort of ut@@ op@@ ian sort of world , we thought , if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda , we might have something .
So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out .
And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Sili@@ con Valley , fly them to Uganda , buy a car , set up the first Internet connection at the National Library of Uganda , figure out what they wanted , and get a program going making books in rural Uganda .
And it actually  so technologi@@ cally , it works .
What we found out of this is we didn &apos;t have the right books .
So the books were in the library . We could get it to people , if they &apos;re di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed , but we didn &apos;t know how to quite get them di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed .
Everybody thought the answer is , send things to India and China .

And so we &apos;ve tried that , and I &apos;ll go over that in a moment .
There are some ne@@ wer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well .
One is a prin@@ t@@ on@@ demand machine that looks like a Ru@@ be Gold@@ berg machine .
We have one of these things now . It &apos;s completely cool .
It &apos;s all conve@@ y@@ or belt , and it makes a book .
And it &apos;s called the &quot; Esp@@ res@@ so Book Machine , &quot; and in about 10 minutes , you can press a button and make a book .
Something else I &apos;m quite excited about in this particular domain , beyond these sort of ki@@ o@@ sk@@ @@ y things where you can get books on demand , is some of these new little screens that are coming out .
And one of my favor@@ ites in this is the $ 100 laptop .
And I don &apos;t mean to steal any th@@ under here , but we &apos;ve gone and used one of these things to be an e@@ book reader .
So here &apos;s one of the beta units and you can  it actually turns out to be a really goo@@ d@@ looking e@@ book reader .
And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it , and it turns out that 200 d@@ ots per inch means that you can put sc@@ anned books on them that look really good .
At 200 d@@ ots per inch , it &apos;s kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer .
We &apos;re in good enough shape .
You actually can go and read sc@@ anned books quite easily .
So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about .
But how do you go about doing all this sc@@ anning ?
So we thought , okay , well , let &apos;s try out this send books to India thing .
And there was a project with , funded by the National Science Foundation  sent a bunch of sc@@ anners , and the American libraries were supposed to send books .
Well , they didn &apos;t . They didn &apos;t want to send their books .
So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India .
And then we learned why you don &apos;t want to send books to India .
The lesson we learned out of this is , scan your own books .
If you really care about books , you &apos;re going to scan them better , especially if they &apos;re valuable books .
If they &apos;re new books and you can just , you know , but@@ cher them , because you could just buy another one , that &apos;s not such a big deal in terms of doing high@@ @@ quality sc@@ anning .
But do things that you love .
But the Indians have been sc@@ anning a lot of their own books  about 300@@ ,000 now  doing very well .
The Chinese did over a million , and the Egyp@@ ti@@ ans are about 3@@ 0,000 .
But we sent  thought , OK , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in@@ @@ library .
How do we go and do this , and how do we get it down so that it &apos;s a cost point that we could afford ?
And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page .
If it &apos;s basically the cost of x@@ ero@@ xing to basically di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze , O@@ CR , package it up , make it so that you could download , print and b@@ ind it  the whole sh@@ eb@@ ang  we would have achieved something .
So we started out trying to figure out . How do we get to 10 cents ?
And we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well  sort of these auto@@ @@ pa@@ ge@@ @@ turning things .
If we can have Mars Ro@@ vers , you &apos;d think you could turn pages .
But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages , and the volume isn &apos;t there .
So anyway  so we ended up making our own book scanner , and with two digital , high@@ @@ grade , professional digital cameras , controlled museum lighting , so even if it &apos;s a black and white book , you can go and get the proper int@@ on@@ ation .
So you basically do a beautiful , respec@@ tful job .
This is not a fax , this is  the idea is to do a beautiful job as you &apos;re going through these libraries .
And we &apos;ve been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume .
This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto .
And actually , it turns out to , you know , pay a living wage .
People seem to love it .
Yes , it &apos;s a little boring , but some people kind of get into the Z@@ en of it .
And especially if it &apos;s kind of interesting books that you care about , in languages that you can read .
We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this , at getting 10 cents a page .
So 10 cents a page , 300 pages in your average book , 30 dollars a book .
The Library of Congress , if you did the whole dar@@ n thing  26 million books  is about 750 million dollars , right ?
But a million books , I think , actually would be a pretty good start , and that would cost 30 million dollars . That &apos;s not that big a bill .
And what we &apos;ve been able to do is get into libraries .
We &apos;ve now got eight of these sc@@ anning centers in three countries , and libraries are up for having their books sc@@ anned .
The Get@@ ty here is moving their books to the UC@@ LA , which is where we have one these sc@@ anning centers , and sc@@ anning their out@@ @@ of@@ @@ copyright books , which is fabulous .
So we &apos;re starting to get the institutional responsibility .
The thing we &apos;re missing is the 10 cents .
If we can get the 10 cents , all the rest of it flows .
We &apos;ve sc@@ anned about 200@@ ,000 books .
Now we &apos;re sc@@ anning about 15@@ ,000 books a month , and it &apos;s starting to gear up another factor of two from there .
So all in all , that &apos;s going very well .
And we &apos;re starting to move out of the just out@@ @@ of@@ @@ copyright into the out@@ @@ of@@ @@ print world .
So I think of  we &apos;re kind of going from the out@@ @@ of@@ @@ copyright , library stuff , and Ama@@ zon@@ .com is coming from the in@@ @@ print world .
And I think we &apos;ll meet in the middle some place , and have the classic thing that you have , which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel .
And so we &apos;re starting up a program to do out@@ @@ of@@ @@ print works , but lo@@ aning them .
Exactly what lo@@ aning means , I &apos;m not quite sure .
But anyway , lo@@ aning out@@ @@ of@@ @@ print works from the Boston Public Library , the Woods H@@ ole Oc@@ ean@@ ographic Institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the book@@ store take over .
So all in all , it &apos;s possible to do this in large scale .
We &apos;re also going back over micro@@ film and getting that online .
So , we can do 10 cents a page , we &apos;re going 15@@ ,000 books a month and we &apos;ve got about 25@@ 0,000 books online , counting all the other projects that are starting to add in .
So what I wanted to argue is , books are within our grasp .
The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal .
Yes , it costs tens of millions , low hundreds of millions , but one time shot and we &apos;ve got basically the history of printed literature online .
And then , there &apos;s business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people .
But it is within our grasp , technologi@@ cally and law@@ @@ wise , at least for the out of print and out of copyright , we suggest , to be able to get the whole dar@@ n thing online .
Now let &apos;s go for audio , and I &apos;m going to go through these .
So how much is there ?
Well , as best we can tell , there are about two to three million dis@@ ks having been published  so 78@@ s , long@@ @@ playing records and CDs  or at least that &apos;s the largest archives of published materials we &apos;ve been able to sort of point at .
It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volume .
But we &apos;ve found that the rights issues are really quite thor@@ ny .
This is a fairly heavily li@@ tig@@ ated area , so we &apos;ve found that there are nich@@ es in the music world that aren &apos;t served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system .
And we &apos;ve been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the Net .
In the United States , it doesn &apos;t cost you to give something away . Right ?
If you give something to a charity or to the public , you get a p@@ at on the back and a tax donation  except on the Net , where you can go broke .
If you put up a video of your garage band , and it starts getting heavily accessed , you can lose your guit@@ ars or your house .
This doesn &apos;t make any sense .
So we &apos;ve offered unlimited storage , unlimited band@@ width , forever , for free , to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library .
And we &apos;ve been getting a lot of ta@@ kers . One is the rock &apos; n &apos; roll@@ ers .
The rock &apos; n &apos; roll@@ ers had a tradition of sharing , as long as nobody made any money . You could  concert recordings , it &apos;s not the commercial recordings , but concert recordings , started by the Grat@@ eful Dead .
And we get about two or three bands a day signing up .
They give permission , and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day .
We have about 4@@ 0,000 concerts , everything the Grat@@ eful Dead ever did , up on the Net , so that people can see it and listen to this material .
So audio is possible to put up , but the rights issues are really pretty thor@@ ny .
We &apos;ve got a lot of collections now  a couple hundred thousand items  and it &apos;s growing over time .
Moving images : if you think of the@@ atri@@ cal releases , there are not that many of them .
As best we can tell , there are about 15@@ 0,000 to 200@@ ,000 movies ever that are really meant for a lar@@ ge@@ @@ scale the@@ atri@@ cal distribution . It &apos;s just not that many .
But half of those were Indian .
But anyway , it &apos;s do@@ able , but we &apos;ve only found about a thousand of these things that  to be out of copyright .
So we &apos;ve di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zed those and made those available .
But we &apos;ve found that there &apos;s lots of other types of movies that haven &apos;t really seen the light of day  archi@@ val films .
We &apos;ve found , also , a lot of political films , a lot of amateur films , all sorts of things that are basically needing a home , a permanent home .
So we &apos;ve been starting to make these available and it &apos;s grown to be very popular .
We &apos;re not quite a YouTube .
We t@@ ended towards lon@@ ger@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .

Tele@@ vision comes quite a bit larger .
We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day .
It &apos;s sort of the biggest Ti@@ V@@ o box you &apos;ve ever seen .
It &apos;s about a pet@@ ab@@ y@@ te , so far , of worldwide television  Russian , Chinese , Japanese , Iraqi , Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era , BBC , CN@@ N , AB@@ C , C@@ BS , N@@ BC  24 hours a day .
We only put one week up , which is mostly for cost reasons , which is the 9 / 11 , sort of from 9 / 11 / 2001 . For one week , what did the world see ?
CN@@ N was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets .
Were they ? Let &apos;s look at the Palestinian television and find out .
How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past ?
And television is dread@@ fully un@@ recorded and un@@ quot@@ able , except by Jon Stewart , who does a fabulous job .
So anyway , television is , I would suggest , within our grasp .
So 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per cell@@ u@@ lo@@ id hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very in@@ expen@@ sively and have them up on the Net .
And we &apos;ve got , now , a lot of these materials .
So we &apos;ve got about 100,000 pieces up there .
So books , music , video , software . There &apos;s only 50,000 titles of it .
Mo@@ stly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy prot@@ ections .
But we &apos;ve worked through some of those , but we &apos;ve still got real problems in Washington .
Well , we &apos;re best known as the World Wide Web .
We &apos;ve been archi@@ ving the World Wide Web since 1996 .
We take a sn@@ ap@@ shot of every website and all of the pages on it , every two months .
And actually , it &apos;s really been pion@@ e@@ ered by Alex@@ a Internet , which don@@ ates this collection to the Internet Archi@@ ve .
And it &apos;s been growing along for the last 11 years , and it &apos;s a fantastic resource .
And we &apos;ve made a Wa@@ y@@ back Machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were .
If you go and search on something  this is Goo@@ gle@@ .com , the different versions of it that we have , this is what it looks like when it was an al@@ pha release , and this is what it looked like at Stanford .
So anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
Mo@@ stly , people want to see their old stuff out of this .
If there &apos;s one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexand@@ ria version one , which is probably best known for burning , is , don &apos;t just have one copy .
So we &apos;ve started to  we &apos;ve made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexand@@ ria .
So this is a picture of the Internet Archi@@ ve at the Library of Alexand@@ ria .
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam .
So , we should put it in the San Andreas F@@ ault Line in San Francisco , flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East . Right , so anyway ...
so we &apos;re he@@ dging our bets here .
If we go and put it in a couple more places , I think we &apos;ll be in good shape .
There &apos;s a political and social question out of this .
Is all of this , as we go digital , is it going to be public or private ?
There &apos;s some large companies that have seen this vision , that are doing lar@@ ge@@ @@ scale di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ation , but they &apos;re locking up the public domain .
The question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
What &apos;s the role of the public versus the private as things go forward ?
How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future , just as we basically benef@@ ited as we were growing up ?
So universal access to all knowledge  I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of human@@ kind , like the man on the moon , or the G@@ uten@@ berg Bible , or the Library of Alexand@@ ria .
It could be something that we &apos;re remembered for , for mill@@ en@@ nia , for having achieved .
And as I said before , I &apos;ll end with something that &apos;s car@@ ved above the door of the Car@@ neg@@ ie Library .
Car@@ neg@@ ie  one of the great capit@@ alists of this country  car@@ ved above his legacy , &quot; Free to the People . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Bre@@ w@@ ster Kah@@ le : A free digital library
Bre@@ w@@ ster Kah@@ le is building a truly huge digital library  every book ever published , every movie ever released , all the str@@ ata of web history ... It &apos;s all free to the public  unless someone else gets to it first .
Imagine , if you will  a gift .
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big  about the size of a golf ball .
So en@@ vision what it looks like all wrapped up .
But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you .
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and re@@ connect with friends and acqua@@ int@@ ances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
Ad@@ oration and admi@@ ration will overwhel@@ m you .
It will rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will re@@ define your sense of spiritu@@ ality and faith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have un@@ sur@@ passed vit@@ ality and energy .
You &apos;ll expand your voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary , meet new people , and you &apos;ll have a health@@ ier lifestyle .
And get this  you &apos;ll have an ei@@ ght@@ @@ week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
You &apos;ll eat countless g@@ ourmet meals .
Flo@@ wers will arrive by the tru@@ ck@@ load .
People will say to you , &quot; You look great . Have you had any work done ? &quot;
And you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
You &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and hum@@ bled .
Your life will have new meaning .
Peace , health , ser@@ en@@ ity , happiness , n@@ ir@@ v@@ ana .
The price ?
$ 55@@ ,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal .
By now I know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
This gift came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up  not quite so pretty .
And this , and then this .
It was a rare gem  a brain tumor , hem@@ an@@ gi@@ ob@@ la@@ stom@@ a  the gift that keeps on giving .
And while I &apos;m okay now , I wouldn &apos;t wish this gift for you .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It pro@@ found@@ ly altered my life in ways I didn &apos;t expect in all the ways I just shared with you .
So the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , un@@ wanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift .

I love a challenge , and saving the Earth is probably a good one .
We all know the Earth is in trouble .
We have now entered in the 6@@ X , the sixth major extin@@ ction on this planet .
I often wondered , if there was a United Organization of Organis@@ ms  otherwise known as &quot; Uh@@ Oh &quot;   and every organism had a right to vote , would we be voted on the planet , or off the planet ?
I think that vote is occurring right now .
I want to present to you a suite of six my@@ c@@ ological solutions , using f@@ ung@@ i , and these solutions are based on my@@ c@@ eli@@ um .
The my@@ c@@ eli@@ um inf@@ uses all landscapes , it holds so@@ ils together , it &apos;s extremely ten@@ ac@@ ious .
This holds up to 3@@ 0,000 times its mass .
They &apos;re the grand molec@@ ular dis@@ assem@@ bl@@ ers of nature  the soil magi@@ cians .
They generate the hum@@ us so@@ ils across the land@@ m@@ asses of Earth .
We have now discovered that there is a multi@@ @@ direc@@ tional transfer of nutri@@ ents between plants , mi@@ tig@@ ated by the m@@ cy@@ eli@@ um  so the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um is the mother that is giving nutri@@ ents from al@@ der and bir@@ ch trees to hem@@ locks , ce@@ dar@@ s and Douglas fir@@ s .

So , I hope to pi@@ erce that prejudice forever with this group .
We call it my@@ cop@@ ho@@ bia , the ir@@ rational fear of the unknown , when it comes to f@@ ung@@ i .
Mus@@ h@@ rooms are very fast in their growth .
Day 21 , day 23 , day 25 .
Mus@@ h@@ rooms produce strong antibio@@ tics .
In fact , we &apos;re more closely related to f@@ ung@@ i than we are to any other kingdom .
A group of 20 eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tic micro@@ bi@@ ologists published a paper two years ago er@@ ecting op@@ is@@ tho@@ kon@@ ta  a super@@ @@ kingdom that jo@@ ins anim@@ alia and f@@ ung@@ i together .
We share in common the same patho@@ gens .
F@@ ung@@ i don &apos;t like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibio@@ tics come from f@@ ung@@ i .
But here is a mush@@ room that &apos;s past its prime .
After they spor@@ ulate , they do rot .
But I propose to you that the sequence of micro@@ bes that occur on rot@@ ting mush@@ rooms are essential for the health of the forest .
They give rise to the trees , they create the de@@ bris fields that feed the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um .
And so we see a mush@@ room here spor@@ ulating .
And the spor@@ es are ger@@ min@@ ating , and the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um forms and goes underground .
In a single cu@@ bic inch of soil , there can be more than eight miles of these cells .
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of my@@ c@@ eli@@ um .
This is phot@@ om@@ icro@@ gra@@ phs from Nick Read and Patrick Hi@@ ckey .
And notice that as the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um grows , it conqu@@ ers territory and then it begins the net .
I &apos;ve been a sc@@ anning elec@@ tron micro@@ scop@@ ist for many years , I have thousands of elec@@ tron micro@@ gra@@ phs , and when I &apos;m staring at the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um , I realize that they are micro@@ fil@@ tration mem@@ bran@@ es .
We ex@@ hale carbon dioxide , so does my@@ c@@ eli@@ um .
It inhal@@ es oxygen , just like we do .
But these are essentially ex@@ tern@@ alized stom@@ ach@@ s and lungs .
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neuro@@ logical mem@@ bran@@ es .
And in these ca@@ vi@@ ties , these micro@@ @@ ca@@ vi@@ ties form , and as they f@@ use so@@ ils , they absor@@ b water .
These are little w@@ ells .
And inside these w@@ ells , then micro@@ bi@@ al communities begin to form .
And so the spon@@ gy soil not only res@@ ists ero@@ sion , but sets up a micro@@ bi@@ al universe that gives rise to a plur@@ ality of other organisms .
I first proposed , in the early 1990s , that my@@ c@@ eli@@ um is Earth &apos;s natural Internet .
When you look at the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um , they &apos;re highly bran@@ ched .
And if there &apos;s one branch that is broken , then very quickly , because of the no@@ des of crossing  Internet engineers maybe call them hot points  there are alternative path@@ ways for chann@@ eling nutri@@ ents and information .
The my@@ c@@ eli@@ um is sen@@ ti@@ ent .
It knows that you are there .
When you walk across landscapes , it le@@ aps up in the after@@ math of your foot@@ steps trying to grab de@@ bris .
So , I believe the invention of the computer Internet is an inevitable consequence of a previously proven , bi@@ ologically successful model .
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit , and we now , being the top organism on this planet , are trying to al@@ locate resources in order to protect the bio@@ sphere .
Going way out , dark matter con@@ forms to the same my@@ c@@ eli@@ al arch@@ et@@ ype .
I believe matter be@@ gets life ; life becomes single cells ; single cells become strings ; strings become chains ; chains network .
And this is the para@@ dig@@ m that we see throughout the universe .
Most of you may not know that f@@ ung@@ i were the first organisms to come to land .
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago , and plants followed several hundred million years later .
How is that possible ?
It &apos;s possible because the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um produces ox@@ ali@@ c aci@@ ds , and many other aci@@ ds and enz@@ y@@ mes , po@@ ck@@ marking rock and grab@@ bing cal@@ ci@@ um and other miner@@ als and forming cal@@ ci@@ um ox@@ al@@ ates .
Makes the rocks crum@@ ble , and the first step in the generation of soil .
Ox@@ ali@@ c acid is two carbon dioxide molec@@ ules joined together .
So , f@@ ung@@ i and my@@ c@@ eli@@ um se@@ ques@@ ter carbon dioxide in the form of cal@@ ci@@ um ox@@ al@@ ates .
And all sorts of other ox@@ al@@ ates are also se@@ ques@@ tering carbon dioxide through the miner@@ als that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix .
This was first discovered in 18@@ 59 .
This is a photograph by Franz Hu@@ e@@ ber .
This photograph &apos;s taken 19@@ 50s in Saudi Arabia .
4@@ 20 million years ago , this organism existed .
It was called Protot@@ ax@@ ites .
Protot@@ ax@@ ites , laying down , was about three feet tall .
The tall@@ est plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet .
Dr. Bo@@ yce , at the University of Chicago , published an article in the Journal of Ge@@ ology this past year determining that Protot@@ ax@@ ites was a giant f@@ ung@@ us , a giant mush@@ room .
A@@ cross the landscapes of Earth were dot@@ ted these giant mush@@ rooms .
All across most land m@@ asses .
And these existed for tens of millions of years .
Now , we &apos;ve had several extin@@ ction events , and as we march forward  65 million years ago  most of you know about it  we had an ast@@ ero@@ id impact .
The Earth was struck by an ast@@ ero@@ id , a huge amount of de@@ bris was jet@@ ti@@ son@@ ed into the atmosphere .
Sun@@ light was cut off , and f@@ ung@@ i inherited the Earth .
Those organisms that pa@@ ired with f@@ ung@@ i were re@@ warded , because f@@ ung@@ i do not need light .
More recently , at Einstein University , they just determined that f@@ ung@@ i use radiation as a source of energy , much like plants use light .
So , the prospect of f@@ ung@@ i existing on other planets elsewhere , I think , is a for@@ gone conclusion , at least in my own mind .
The largest organism in the world is in Eastern O@@ reg@@ on .
I couldn &apos;t miss it . It was 2,@@ 200 acres in size : 2,@@ 200 acres in size , 2,000 years old .
The largest organism on the planet is a my@@ c@@ eli@@ al mat , one cell wall thick .
How is it that this organism can be so large , and yet be one cell wall thick , whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us ?
The my@@ c@@ eli@@ um , in the right conditions , produces a mush@@ room  it bur@@ sts through with such fer@@ oc@@ ity that it can break as@@ p@@ halt .
We were involved with several experiments .
I &apos;m going to show you six , if I can , solutions for helping to save the world .
Bat@@ telle Labor@@ atories and I joined up in Bell@@ ingham , Washington .
There were four pil@@ es sat@@ ur@@ ated with diesel and other pet@@ ro@@ le@@ um waste : one was a control pile ; one pile was treated with enz@@ y@@ mes ; one pile was treated with bacteria ; and our pile we in@@ oc@@ ulated with mush@@ room my@@ c@@ eli@@ um .
The my@@ c@@ eli@@ um absor@@ bs the oil .
The my@@ c@@ eli@@ um is producing enz@@ y@@ mes  per@@ oxi@@ das@@ es  that break car@@ bon@@ @@ hydro@@ gen bonds .
These are the same bonds that hold hydro@@ car@@ bons together .
So , the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um becomes sat@@ ur@@ ated with the oil , and then , when we returned six weeks later , all the tar@@ ps were removed , all the other pil@@ es were dead , dark and stin@@ ky .
We came back to our pile , it was covered with hundreds of pounds of o@@ yst@@ er mush@@ rooms , and the color changed to a light form .
The enz@@ y@@ mes re@@ manufactured the hydro@@ car@@ bons into car@@ b@@ oh@@ y@@ dr@@ ates  f@@ ung@@ al su@@ gar@@ s .
Some of these mush@@ rooms are very happy mush@@ rooms .
They &apos;re very large .
They &apos;re showing how much nutrition that they could &apos;ve obtained .
But something else happened , which was an epi@@ ph@@ any in my life .
They spor@@ ulated , the spor@@ es attract in@@ sects , the in@@ sects laid eggs , eggs became lar@@ va@@ e .
Bir@@ ds then came , bringing in seeds , and our pile became an oasis of life .
Whereas the other three pil@@ es were dead , dark and stin@@ ky , and the PA@@ H &apos;s  the arom@@ atic hydro@@ car@@ bons  went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks .
The last image we don &apos;t have .
The entire pile was a green ber@@ m of life .
These are g@@ ateway species , van@@ guard species that open the door for other biological communities .
So I invented bur@@ lap s@@ acks , bunker spa@@ wn  and putting the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um  using storm blown de@@ bris , you can take these bur@@ lap s@@ acks and put them down@@ stream from a farm that &apos;s producing E. col@@ i , or other wa@@ stes , or a factory with chemical tox@@ ins , and it leads to habit@@ at restoration .
So , we set up a site in Mason County , Washington , and we &apos;ve seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of co@@ li@@ forms .
And I &apos;ll show you a graph here .
This is a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic scale , 10 to the eigh@@ th power .
There &apos;s more than a 100 million col@@ onies per gram , and 10 to the third power is around 1,000 .
In 48 hours to 72 hours , these three mush@@ room species reduced the amount of co@@ li@@ form bacteria 10,000 times .
Think of the implications .
This is a spac@@ e@@ conservative method that uses storm de@@ bris  and we can guarantee that we will have stor@@ ms every year .
So , this one mush@@ room , in particular , has drawn our interest over time .
This is my wife Du@@ sty , with a mush@@ room called F@@ om@@ it@@ op@@ sis offic@@ in@@ alis  Ag@@ ari@@ kon .
It &apos;s a mush@@ room exclusive to the ol@@ d@@ growth forest that Di@@ o@@ sc@@ ori@@ des first described in 65 A.@@ D .
have proceeded 2300 lines.

as a treatment against consumption .
This mush@@ room grows in Washington State , O@@ reg@@ on , northern California , British Columbia , now thought to be extin@@ ct in Europe .
May not seem that large  let &apos;s get closer .
This is extremely rare f@@ ung@@ us .
Our team  and we have a team of experts that go out  we went out 20 times in the ol@@ d@@ growth forest last year .
We found one sample to be able to get into culture .
Pres@@ er@@ ving the gen@@ ome of these f@@ ung@@ i in the ol@@ d@@ growth forest I think is absolutely critical for human health .
I &apos;ve been involved with the U.S. Defense Department Bio@@ Shi@@ eld program .
We submitted over 300 samples of mush@@ rooms that were bo@@ iled in hot water , and my@@ c@@ eli@@ um harv@@ esting these ex@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular met@@ abo@@ lit@@ es .
And a few years ago , we received these results .
We have three different stra@@ ins of Ag@@ ari@@ kon mush@@ rooms that were highly active against po@@ x@@ viruses .
Dr. Earl Kern , who &apos;s a small@@ po@@ x expert of the U.S. Defense Department , states that any com@@ pounds that have a sel@@ ec@@ tivity index of two or more are active .
10 or greater are considered to be very active .
Our mush@@ room stra@@ ins were in the highly active range .
There &apos;s a vet@@ ted press release that you can read  it &apos;s vet@@ ted by DO@@ D  if you Google &quot; Stam@@ ets &quot; and &quot; small@@ po@@ x . &quot;
Or you can go to N@@ PR@@ .org and listen to a live interview .
So , encouraged by this , naturally we went to flu viruses .
And so , for the first time , I am showing this .
We have three different stra@@ ins of Ag@@ ari@@ kon mush@@ rooms highly active against flu viruses .
Here &apos;s the sel@@ ec@@ tivity index numbers  against po@@ x , you saw 10@@ s and 20@@ s  now against flu viruses , compared to the ri@@ ba@@ vir@@ in controls , we have an extra@@ ordin@@ arily high activity .
And we &apos;re using a natural extract within the same do@@ sage window as a pure pharmaceutical .
We tried it against flu A viruses  H@@ 1@@ N@@ 1 , H@@ 3@@ N@@ 2  as well as flu B viruses .
So then we tried a blend , and in a blend combination we tried it against H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 , and we got greater than 1,000 sel@@ ec@@ tivity index .
I then think that we can make the argument that we should save the ol@@ d@@ growth forest as a matter of national defense .
I became interested in ent@@ om@@ opath@@ o@@ genic f@@ ung@@ i  f@@ ung@@ i that kill in@@ sects .
Our house was being destroyed by car@@ p@@ enter ants .
So , I went to the EPA homepage , and they were recomm@@ ending studies with met@@ ar@@ hi@@ zi@@ um species of a group of f@@ ung@@ i that kill car@@ p@@ enter ants , as well as ter@@ mit@@ es .
I did something that nobody else had done .
I actually ch@@ ased the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um , when it stopped producing spor@@ es .
These are spor@@ es  this is in their spor@@ es .
I was able to mor@@ ph the culture into a non@@ spor@@ ulating form .
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars specifically on bait stations to prevent ter@@ mit@@ es from eating your house .
But the in@@ sects aren &apos;t stupid , and they would avoid the spor@@ es when they came close , and so I mor@@ ph@@ ed the cultures into a non@@ spor@@ ulating form .
And I got my daughter &apos;s Barbie doll dish , I put it right where a bunch of car@@ p@@ enter ants were making de@@ bris fields , every day , in my house , and the ants were attracted to the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um , because there &apos;s no spor@@ es .
They gave it to the queen .
One week later , I had no sa@@ w@@ dust pil@@ es whatsoever .
And then  a delicate dance between dinner and death  the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um is consumed by the ants , they become mum@@ mi@@ fied , and , bo@@ ing , a mush@@ room po@@ ps out of their head .
Now after spor@@ ulation , the spor@@ es rep@@ el .
So , the house is no longer suitable for invasion .
So , you have a near@@ @@ permanent solution for re@@ invasion of ter@@ mit@@ es .
And so my house came down , I received my first patent against car@@ p@@ enter ants , ter@@ mit@@ es and fire ants .
Then we tried ex@@ trac@@ ts , and lo and behold , we can ste@@ er in@@ sects to different directions .
This has huge implications .
I then received my second patent  and this is a big one .
It &apos;s been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent .
It covers over 200@@ ,000 species .
This is the most disrup@@ tive technology  I &apos;ve been told by execu@@ tives of the pesti@@ cide industry  that they have ever witnessed .
This could totally re@@ v@@ amp the pesti@@ cide industries throughout the world .
You could fly 100 Ph@@ .@@ D. students under the umbrella of this concept , because my sup@@ position is that ent@@ om@@ opath@@ o@@ genic f@@ ung@@ i , prior to spor@@ ulation , attract the very in@@ sects that are otherwise rep@@ elled by those spor@@ es .
And so I came up with a Life Box , because I needed a delivery system .
The Life Box  you &apos;re gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference  you add soil , you add water , you have my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ z@@ al and end@@ op@@ hy@@ tic f@@ ung@@ i as well as spor@@ es , like of the Ag@@ ari@@ kon mush@@ room .
The seeds then are mother@@ ed by this my@@ c@@ eli@@ um .
And then you put tree seeds in here , and then you end up growing  potentially  an ol@@ d@@ growth forest from a card@@ board box .
I want to re@@ inv@@ ent the delivery system , and the use of card@@ board around the world , so they become ecological foot@@ prints .
If there &apos;s a You@@ Tu@@ be@@ @@ like site that you could put up , you could make it interactive , zip code specific  where people could join together , and through satellite ima@@ ging systems , through Virtual Earth or Google Earth , you could confirm carbon credits are being se@@ ques@@ tered by the trees that are coming through Life Bo@@ xes .
You could take a card@@ board box delivering shoes , you could add water  I developed this for the refugee community  cor@@ ns , beans and squ@@ ash and oni@@ ons .
I took several containers  my wife said , if I could do this , anybody could  and I ended up growing a seed garden .
Then you harvest the seeds  and thank you , Eric Ras@@ mus@@ sen , for your help on this  and then you &apos;re harv@@ esting the seed garden .
Then you can harvest the k@@ ern@@ els , and then you just need a few k@@ ern@@ els .
I add my@@ c@@ eli@@ um to it , and then I in@@ oc@@ ulate the cor@@ n@@ co@@ bs .
Now , three cor@@ n@@ co@@ bs , no other grain  lots of mush@@ rooms begin to form .
Too many withdraw@@ als from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down .
But watch what happens here .
The mush@@ rooms then are harv@@ ested , but very importantly , the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um has converted the cell@@ u@@ lose into f@@ ung@@ al su@@ gar@@ s .
And so I thought , how could we address the energy crisis in this country ?
And we came up with E@@ con@@ ol .
Gener@@ ating eth@@ an@@ ol from cell@@ u@@ lose using my@@ c@@ eli@@ um as an intermedi@@ ary  and you gain all the benefits that I &apos;ve described to you already .
But to go from cell@@ u@@ lose to eth@@ an@@ ol is ec@@ ologically un@@ intelligent , and I think that we need to be ec@@ on@@ ologically intelligent about the generation of fuels .
So , we build the carbon banks on the planet , rene@@ w the so@@ ils .
These are a species that we need to join with .
I think eng@@ aging my@@ c@@ eli@@ um can help save the world .
Thank you very much .
Paul Stam@@ ets : 6 ways mush@@ rooms can save the world
My@@ c@@ ologist Paul Stam@@ ets lists 6 ways the my@@ c@@ eli@@ um f@@ ung@@ us can help save the universe : cleaning poll@@ uted soil , making in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cides , treating small@@ po@@ x and even flu ... &amp; lt ; a h@@ re@@ f = &quot; http : / / www.@@ te@@ d@@ .com / in@@ dex@@ .@@ php / speakers / view / id / 2@@ 29 &quot; target = &quot; _ blank &quot; &amp; gt ; Read more &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ; .
I have had the distinct pleasure of living inside two bio@@ sp@@ heres .
Of course we all here in this room live in Bio@@ sphere 1 .
I &apos;ve also lived in Bio@@ sphere 2 .
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare bio@@ sp@@ heres .
And hopefully from that I get to learn something .
So what did I learn ? Well , here I am inside Bio@@ sphere 2 , making a pizza .
So I am harv@@ esting the wheat , in order to make the dough .
And then of course I have to milk the go@@ ats and feed the go@@ ats in order to make the cheese .
It took me four months in Bio@@ sphere 2 to make a pizza .
Here in Bio@@ sphere 1 , well it takes me about two minutes , because I pick up the phone and I call and say , &quot; Hey , can you deliver the pizza ? &quot;
So Bio@@ sphere 2 was essentially a thre@@ e@@ acre , entirely sealed , mini@@ ature world that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes .
Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass , underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel  essentially entirely sealed .
So we had our own mini@@ ature rain@@ forest , a private beach with a cor@@ al re@@ ef .
We had a sav@@ anna , a mar@@ sh , a desert .
We had our own half@@ @@ acre farm that we had to grow everything .
And of course we had our human habit@@ at , where we lived .
Back in the mid@@  &apos; 80@@ s when we were designing Bio@@ sphere 2 , we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions .
I mean , what is a bio@@ sphere ?
Back then , yes , I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth , right ?
Well , you have to get a little more specific than that if you &apos;re going to build one .
And so we decided that what it really is is that it is entirely materi@@ ally closed  that is , nothing goes in or out at all , no material  and energe@@ tically open , which is essentially what planet Earth is .
This is a chamber that was 1 / 400@@ th the size of Bio@@ sphere 2 that we called our Test Module .
And the very first day that this fellow , John Allen , walked in , to spend a couple of days in there with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we &apos;d put in there to hopefully keep him alive , the doctors were incredibly concerned that he was going to succ@@ um@@ b to some dreadful tox@@ in , or that his lungs were going to get cho@@ ked with bacteria or something , f@@ ung@@ us .
But of course none of that happened .
And over the en@@ su@@ ing few years , there were great sag@@ as about designing Bio@@ sphere 2 .
But by 1991 we finally had this thing built .
have proceeded 2400 lines.

And it was time for us to go in and give it a go .
We needed to know , is life this m@@ alle@@ able ?
Can you take this bio@@ sphere , that has evolved on a plan@@ etary scale , and jam it into a little bottle , and will it survive ?
Big questions .
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else in the universe  if we were going to go to Mars , for instance , would we take a bio@@ sphere with us , to live in it ?
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about the Earth that we all live in .
Well , in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in and try out this baby .
Let &apos;s take it on a ma@@ iden voyage .
Will it work ? Or will something happen that we can &apos;t understand and we can &apos;t fix , thereby neg@@ ating the concept of man@@ @@ made bio@@ sp@@ heres ?
So eight of us went in : four men and four women .
More on that later .
And this is the world that we lived in .
So , on the top , we had these beautiful rain@@ forests and an ocean , and underneath we had all this tech@@ no@@ sphere , we called it , which is where all the pumps and the val@@ ves and the water tanks and the air hand@@ lers , and all of that .
One of the Bio@@ sp@@ her@@ ians called it &quot; garden of Eden on top of an aircraft carrier . &quot;
And then also we had the human habit@@ at of course , with the laboratories , and all of that .
This is the agriculture .
It was essentially an organic farm .
The day I walked into Bio@@ sphere 2 , I was , for the first time , breathing a completely different atmosphere than everybody else in the world , except seven other people .
At that moment I became part of that bio@@ sphere .
And I don &apos;t mean that in an abstra@@ ct sense ; I mean it rather literally .
When I breath@@ ed out , my CO2 fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing .
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes .
And those sweet potatoes became part of me .
In fact , we ate so many sweet potatoes I became orange with sweet potato .
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again .
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way .
When it came to our atmosphere , however , it wasn &apos;t that much of a joke over the long term , because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
And we knew that we were losing CO2 .
And so we were working to se@@ ques@@ ter carbon .
Good lord  we know that term now .
We were growing plants like crazy .
We were taking their bi@@ om@@ ass , stor@@ ing them in the basement , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere .
We stopped ir@@ rig@@ ating our soil , as much as we could .
We stopped till@@ ing , so that we could prevent greenhouse g@@ asses from going into the air .
But our oxygen was going down faster than our CO2 was going up , which was quite unexpected , because we had seen them going in tan@@ dem in the test module .
And it was like playing atomic hide@@ @@ and@@ @@ seek .
We had lost seven tons of oxygen .
And we had no clue where it was .
And I tell you , when you lose a lot of oxygen  and our oxygen went down quite far ; it went from 21 percent down to 14.@@ 2 percent  my goodness , do you feel dreadful .
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Bio@@ sphere .
And we had sleep ap@@ ne@@ a at night .
So you &apos;d wake up gas@@ ping with breath , because your blood chemistry has changed .
And that you literally do that . You stop breathing and then you   take a breath and it wa@@ kes you up . And it &apos;s very irrit@@ ating .
And everybody outside thought we were dying .
I mean , the media was making it sound like were were dying .
And I had to call up my mother every other day saying , &quot; No , Mum , it &apos;s fine , fine .
We &apos;re not dead . We &apos;re fine . We &apos;re fine . &quot;
And the doctor was , in fact , checking us to make sure we were , in fact , fine .
But in fact he was the person who was most sus@@ cep@@ tible to the oxygen .
And one day he couldn &apos;t add up a line of figures .
And it was time for us to put oxygen in .
And you might think , well , &quot; Boy , your life support system was failing you . Wasn &apos;t that dreadful ? &quot;
Yes . In a sense it was terri@@ fying .
Except that I knew I could walk out the air@@ lock door at any time , if it really got bad , though who was going to say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore ! &quot; ?
Not me , that was for sure .
But on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really c@@ rank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
And we did indeed find it .
And we found it in the concrete .
Essen@@ ti@@ ally it had done something very simple .
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of com@@ post .
It broke down ; it took oxygen out of the air ; it put CO2 into the air ; and it went into the concrete .
Pretty straight@@ forward really .
So at the end of the two years when we came out , we were el@@ ated , because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite &quot; u@@ hh , &quot; when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that &apos;s a very bad failure .
Except that we knew what it was . And we knew how to fix it .
And nothing else emerged that really was as serious as that .
And we proved the concept , more or less .
People , on the other hand , was a different subject .
We were  yeah I don &apos;t know that we were fix@@ able .
We all went quite nuts , I will say .
And the day I came out of Bio@@ sphere 2 , I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends .
For two years I &apos;d been seeing people through the glass .
And everybody ran up to me .
And I reco@@ iled . They st@@ ank !
People stink !
We stink of hair@@ spray and under@@ arm de@@ od@@ or@@ ant , and all kinds of stuff .
Now we had stuff inside Bio@@ sphere to keep ourselves clean , but nothing with perfume .
And boy do we stink out here .
Not only that , but I lost touch of where my food came from .
I had been growing all my own food .
I had no idea what was in my food , where it came from .
I didn &apos;t even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating .
In fact , I would stand for hours in the ais@@ les of shops , reading all the names on all of the things .
People must have thought I was nuts .
It was really quite aston@@ ishing .
And I slowly lost track of where I was in this big bio@@ sphere , in this big bio@@ sphere that we all live in .
In Bio@@ sphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my bio@@ sphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very vis@@ cer@@ ally , very literally .
So I went about my business : Par@@ agon Space Development Corporation , a little firm I started with people while I was in the Bio@@ sphere , because I had nothing else to do .
And one of the things we did was try to figure out : how small can you make these bio@@ sp@@ heres , and what can you do with them ?
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station .
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station , for 16 months , where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space  really pushing the envelope of understanding how m@@ alle@@ able our life systems are .
And I &apos;m also proud to announce that you &apos;re getting a sneak pre@@ view  on Friday we &apos;re going to announce that we &apos;re actually forming a team to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon , which is going to be pretty fun .
And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing : an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars .
And part of that is that we had to model very rapid circulation of CO2 and oxygen and water through this plant system .
As a result of that model@@ ing I ended up in all places , in Er@@ it@@ rea , in the Horn of Africa .
Er@@ it@@ rea , formerly part of Ethiop@@ ia , is one of those places that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly beautiful , incredibly stark , and I have no understanding of how people e@@ ke out a living there .
It is so dry .
This is what I saw .
But this is also what I saw .
I saw a company that had taken sea@@ water and sand , and they were growing a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it .
have proceeded 2500 lines.

And it will produce a food crop .
In this case it was o@@ il@@ seed .
It was aston@@ ishing . They were also producing man@@ gro@@ ves in a plant@@ ation .
And the man@@ gro@@ ves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals , so that they could produce milk and what@@ not , like we had in the Bio@@ sphere .
And all of it was coming from this : shri@@ mp farms .
Sh@@ ri@@ mp farms are a sc@@ our@@ ge on the earth , frankly , from an environmental point of view .
They pour huge amounts of poll@@ ut@@ ants into the ocean .
They also pollu@@ te their nex@@ t@@ door neighbors .
So they &apos;re all shit@@ ting each other &apos;s pon@@ ds , quite literally .
And what this project was doing was taking the eff@@ lu@@ ent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
They were literally turning pollution into abund@@ ance for a desert people .
They had created an industrial eco@@ system , of a sense .
I was there because I was actually model@@ ing the man@@ gro@@ ve portion for a carbon credit program , under the U.@@ N .
Kyoto Protocol system .
And as I was model@@ ing this man@@ gro@@ ve sw@@ amp , I was thinking to myself , &quot; How do you put a box around this ? &quot;
When I &apos;m model@@ ing a plant in a box , literally , I know where to draw the boun@@ dary .
In a man@@ gro@@ ve forest like this I have no idea .
Well , of course you have to draw the boun@@ dary around the whole of the Earth .
And understand its inter@@ actions with the entire Earth .
And put your project in that context .
Around the world today we &apos;re seeing an incredible transformation , from what I would call a bio@@ ci@@ dal species , one that  whether we inten@@ tionally or un@@ inten@@ tionally  have designed our systems to kill life , a lot of the time .
This is in fact , this beautiful photograph , is in fact over the Amazon .
And here the light green are areas of massive de@@ for@@ estation .
And those beautiful wis@@ py clouds are , in fact , fires , human@@ @@ made fires .
We &apos;re in the process of trans@@ forming from this , to what I would call a bi@@ ophi@@ lic society , one where we learn to nur@@ ture society .
Now it may not seem like it , but we are .
It is happening all across the world , in every kind of walk of life , and every kind of career and industry that you can think of .
And I think often times people get lost in that .
They go , &quot; But how can I possibly find my way in that ?
It &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
And I would say that the small stuff counts . It really does .
This is the story of a ra@@ ke in my back@@ yard .
This was my back@@ yard , very early on , when I bought my property .
And in Arizona , of course , everybody puts gra@@ vel down .
And they like to keep everything beautifully ra@@ ked . And they keep all the leaves away .
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blo@@ wer comes out , and I want to thro@@ t@@ tle them .
It &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
We &apos;re very uncomfortable with un@@ ti@@ d@@ iness .
And I threw away my ra@@ ke .
And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property .
And over time , essentially what have I been doing ?
I &apos;ve been building top@@ soil .
And so now all the birds come in . And I have haw@@ ks .
And I have an oasis .
This is what happens every spring . For six weeks , six to eight weeks , I have this flush of green oasis .
This is actually in a ri@@ par@@ ian area .
And all of Tu@@ c@@ son could be like this if everybody would just revol@@ t and throw away the ra@@ ke .
The small stuff counts .
The Industrial Revolution  and Pro@@ meth@@ eus  has given us this , the ability to light up the world .
It has also given us this , the ability to look at the world from the outside .
Now we may not all have another bio@@ sphere that we can run to , and compare it to this bio@@ sphere .
But we can look at the world , and try to understand where we are in its context , and how we choose to inter@@ act with it .
And if you lose where you are in your bio@@ sphere , or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the bio@@ sphere , I would say to you , take a deep breath .
The yo@@ g@@ is had it right .
Bre@@ ath does , in fact , connect us all in a very liter@@ al way .
Take a breath now .
And as you breathe , think about what is in your breath .
There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting nex@@ t@@ door to you .
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some al@@ ga@@ e on the beach not far from here .
It also connects us in time .
There may be some carbon in your breath from the d@@ inosau@@ rs .
There could also be carbon that you are ex@@ hal@@ ing now that will be in the breath of your great@@ @@ great@@ @@ great@@ @@ grand@@ children .
Thank you .
Jane Po@@ yn@@ ter : Life in Bio@@ sphere 2
Jane Po@@ yn@@ ter tells her story of living two years and 20 minutes in Bio@@ sphere 2  an experience that provo@@ ked her to explore how we might sustain life in the har@@ sh@@ est of environments . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
I got my start in writing and research as a surgical train@@ ee , as someone who was a long ways away from becoming any kind of an expert at anything .
So the natural question you ask then at that point is , how do I get good at what I &apos;m trying to do ?
And it became a question of , how do we all get good at what we &apos;re trying to do ?
It &apos;s hard enough to learn to get the skills , try to learn all the material you have to absor@@ b at any task you &apos;re taking on .
I had to think about how I se@@ w and how I cut , but then also how I pick the right person to come to an operating room .
And then in the midst of all this came this new context for thinking about what it meant to be good .
In the last few years we realized we were in the deep@@ est crisis of medicine &apos;s existence due to something you don &apos;t normally think about when you &apos;re a doctor concerned with how you do good for people , which is the cost of health care .
There &apos;s not a country in the world that now is not asking whether we can afford what doctors do .
The political fight that we &apos;ve developed has become one around whether it &apos;s the government that &apos;s the problem or is it insurance companies that are the problem .
And the answer is yes and no ; it &apos;s deeper than all of that .
The cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
And in order to understand this , I &apos;m going to take you back a couple of generations .
I want to take you back to a time when Lewis Thomas was writing in his book , &quot; The Yo@@ ungest Science . &quot;
Lewis Thomas was a physi@@ ci@@ an@@ @@ writer , one of my favorite writers .
And he wrote this book to explain , among other things , what it was like to be a medical intern at the Boston City Hospital in the pre@@ pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in year of 19@@ 37 .
It was a time when medicine was cheap and very in@@ effective .
If you were in a hospital , he said , it was going to do you good only because it offered you some warmth , some food , shelter , and maybe the caring attention of a nurse .
Doc@@ tors and medicine made no difference at all .
That didn &apos;t seem to prevent the doctors from being fran@@ tically busy in their days , as he explained .
What they were trying to do was figure out whether you might have one of the diagno@@ ses for which they could do something .
And there were a few .
You might have a lo@@ bar pneum@@ onia , for example , and they could give you an anti@@ ser@@ um , an injection of ra@@ bid anti@@ bodies to the bac@@ terium stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ cc@@ us , if the intern sub@@ @@ typ@@ ed it correctly .
If you had an acute con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , they could bleed a p@@ int of blood from you by opening up an arm v@@ ein , giving you a cru@@ de leaf preparation of digit@@ alis and then giving you oxygen by tent .
If you had early signs of paraly@@ sis and you were really good at asking personal questions , you might figure out that this paraly@@ sis someone has is from s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis , in which case you could give this nice con@@ co@@ ction of mercury and ar@@ sen@@ ic  as long as you didn &apos;t over@@ dose them and kill them .
Beyond these sorts of things , a medical doctor didn &apos;t have a lot that they could do .
This was when the core structure of medicine was created  what it meant to be good at what we did and how we wanted to build medicine to be .
It was at a time when what was known you could know , you could hold it all in your head , and you could do it all .
If you had a prescription pad , if you had a nurse , if you had a hospital that would give you a place to con@@ val@@ es@@ ce , maybe some basic tools , you really could do it all .
You set the frac@@ ture , you drew the blood , you sp@@ un the blood , looked at it under the micro@@ scope , you pl@@ ated the culture , you in@@ jected the anti@@ ser@@ um .
This was a life as a cra@@ fts@@ man .
As a result , we built it around a culture and set of values that said what you were good at was being dar@@ ing , at being coura@@ geous , at being independent and self@@ sufficient .
Autonom@@ y was our highest value .
Go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
We have now found treatments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
We can &apos;t cure it all .

We can &apos;t guarantee that everybody will live a long and healthy life .
But we can make it possible for most .
But what does it take ?
Well , we &apos;ve now discovered 4@@ ,000 medical and surgical procedures .
We &apos;ve discovered 6@@ ,000 drugs that I &apos;m now licensed to prescri@@ be .
And we &apos;re trying to deplo@@ y this capability , town by town , to every person alive  in our own country , let alone around the world .
And we &apos;ve reached the point where we &apos;ve realized , as doctors , we can &apos;t know it all .
We can &apos;t do it all by ourselves .
There was a study where they looked at how many clin@@ ici@@ ans it took to take care of you if you came into a hospital , as it changed over time .
And in the year 1970 , it took just over two ful@@ l@@ @@ time equi@@ val@@ ents of clin@@ ici@@ ans .
That is to say , it took basically the nur@@ sing time and then just a little bit of time for a doctor who more or less checked in on you once a day .
By the end of the 20th century , it had become more than 15 clin@@ ici@@ ans for the same typical hospital patient  specialists , physical therap@@ ists , the nurses .
We &apos;re all specialists now , even the primary care physi@@ cians .
Everyone just has a piece of the care .
But holding onto that structure we built around the dar@@ ing , independence , self@@ suffici@@ ency of each of those people has become a disaster .
We have trained , hired and re@@ warded people to be co@@ w@@ boys .
But it &apos;s pit cre@@ ws that we need , pit cre@@ ws for patients .
There &apos;s evidence all around us : 40 percent of our cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease patients in our communities receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
60 percent of our as@@ th@@ ma , stroke patients receive incomplete or inappropriate care .
Two million people come into hospitals and pick up an infection they didn &apos;t have because someone failed to follow the basic practices of hygiene .
Our experience as people who get sick , need help from other people , is that we have amazing clin@@ ici@@ ans that we can turn to  hard@@ working , incredibly well@@ @@ trained and very smart  that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope , but little sense that it consistently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way .
There &apos;s another sign that we need pit cre@@ ws , and that &apos;s the un@@ man@@ age@@ able cost of our care .
Now we in medicine , I think , are b@@ aff@@ led by this question of cost .
We want to say , &quot; This is just the way it is .
This is just what medicine requires . &quot;
When you go from a world where you treated ar@@ thri@@ tis with aspir@@ in , that mostly didn &apos;t do the job , to one where , if it gets bad enough , we can do a hip replacement , a knee replacement that gives you years , maybe decades , without disability , a dramatic change , well is it any surprise that that $ 4@@ 0,000 hip replacement replacing the 10@@ @@ cent aspir@@ in is more expensive ?
It &apos;s just the way it is .
But I think we &apos;re ignoring certain facts that tell us something about what we can do .
As we &apos;ve looked at the data about the results that have come as the complexity has increased , we found that the most expensive care is not necessarily the best care .
And vice vers@@ a , the best care often turns out to be the least expensive  has fewer complic@@ ations , the people get more efficient at what they do .
And what that means is there &apos;s hope .
Because &#91; if &#93; to have the best results , you really needed the most expensive care in the country , or in the world , well then we really would be talking about ra@@ tioning who we &apos;re going to cut off from Medi@@ care .
That would be really our only choice .
But when we look at the positive devi@@ ants  the ones who are getting the best results at the lowest costs  we find the ones that look the most like systems are the most successful .
That is to say , they found ways all of the different components , to come together into a whole .
Having great components is not enough , and yet we &apos;ve been obsessed in medicine with components .
We want the best drugs , the best technologies , the best specialists , but we don &apos;t think too much about how it all comes together .
It &apos;s a terrible design strategy actually .
There &apos;s a famous thought experiment that touches exactly on this that said , what if you built a car from the very best car parts ?
Well it would lead you to put in Porsche bra@@ kes , a Ferrari engine , a Vol@@ vo body , a BMW ch@@ ass@@ is .
And you put it all together and what do you get ?
A very expensive pile of junk that does not go anywhere .
And that is what medicine can feel like sometimes .
It &apos;s not a system .
Now a system , however , when things start to come together , you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way .
S@@ kill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
When you are a specialist , you can &apos;t see the end result very well .
You have to become really interested in data , un@@ sexy as that sounds .
One of my colleagues is a surgeon in C@@ ed@@ ar Rap@@ ids , Io@@ wa , and he got interested in the question of , well how many CT sc@@ ans did they do for their community in C@@ ed@@ ar Rap@@ ids ?
He got interested in this because there had been government reports , newspaper reports , journal articles saying that there had been too many CT sc@@ ans done .
He didn &apos;t see it in his own patients .
And so he asked the question , &quot; How many did we do ? &quot;
and he wanted to get the data .
It took him three months .
No one had asked this question in his community before .
And what he found was that , for the 300@@ ,000 people in their community , in the previous year they had done 5@@ 2,000 CT sc@@ ans .
They had found a problem .
Which brings us to skill number two a system has .
S@@ kill one , find where your failures are .
S@@ kill two is devis@@ e solutions .
I got interested in this when the World Health Organization came to my team asking if we could help with a project to reduce deaths in surgery .
The volume of surgery had spread around the world , but the safety of surgery had not .
Now our usual tactics for tackling problems like these are to do more training , give people more speci@@ alization or bring in more technology .
Well in surgery , you couldn &apos;t have people who are more specialized and you couldn &apos;t have people who are better trained .
And yet we see un@@ consci@@ onable levels of death , disability that could be avoided .
And so we looked at what other high@@ @@ risk industries do .
We looked at sky@@ scra@@ per construction , we looked at the aviation world , and we found that they have technology , they have training , and then they have one other thing : They have chec@@ kl@@ ists .
I did not expect to be spending a significant part of my time as a Harvard surgeon worrying about chec@@ kl@@ ists .
And yet , what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better .
We got the lead safety engineer for Bo@@ eing to help us .
Could we design a chec@@ kl@@ ist for surgery ?
Not for the lowest people on the tot@@ em pole , but for the folks who were all the way around the chain , the entire team including the sur@@ geons .
And what they taught us was that designing a chec@@ kl@@ ist to help people handle complexity actually involves more difficulty than I had understood .
You have to think about things like pause points .
You need to identify the moments in a process when you can actually catch a problem before it &apos;s a danger and do something about it .
You have to identify that this is a be@@ for@@ e@@ take@@ off chec@@ kl@@ ist .
And then you need to focus on the killer items .
An aviation chec@@ kl@@ ist , like this one for a sing@@ le@@ @@ engine plane , isn &apos;t a recipe for how to fly a plane , it &apos;s a reminder of the key things that get forgotten or missed if they &apos;re not checked .
So we did this .
We created a 19@@ @@ item two@@ @@ minute chec@@ kl@@ ist for surgical teams .
We had the pause points immediately before an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia is given , immediately before the knife hits the skin , immediately before the patient leaves the room .
And we had a mix of dumb stuff on there  making sure an antibio@@ tic is given in the right time frame because that cuts the infection rate by half  and then interesting stuff , because you can &apos;t make a recipe for something as complicated as surgery .
Instead , you can make a recipe for how to have a team that &apos;s prepared for the unexpected .
And we had items like making sure everyone in the room had introduced themselves by name at the start of the day , because you get half a dozen people or more who are sometimes coming together as a team for the very first time that day that you &apos;re coming in .
We implemented this chec@@ kl@@ ist in eight hospitals around the world , deliberately in places from rural Tanz@@ ania to the University of Washington in Seattle .
We found that after they adopted it the complic@@ ation rates fell 35 percent .
It fell in every hospital it went into .
The death rates fell 47 percent .
This was bigger than a drug .
And that brings us to skill number three , the ability to implement this , to get colleagues across the entire chain to actually do these things .
And it &apos;s been slow to spread .
This is not yet our norm in surgery  let alone making chec@@ kl@@ ists to go onto child@@ birth and other areas .
There &apos;s a deep resistance because using these tools forces us to confront that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to behave with a different set of values .
Just using a chec@@ kl@@ ist requires you to embrace different values from the ones we &apos;ve had , like humili@@ ty , discipline , te@@ am@@ work .
This is the opposite of what we were built on : independence , self@@ suffici@@ ency , autonomy .
I met an actual cowboy , by the way .
I asked him , what was it like to actually herd a thousand cattle across hundreds of miles ?
How did you do that ?
And he said , &quot; We have the co@@ w@@ boys station@@ ed at distinct places all around . &quot;
They communicate electron@@ ically constantly , and they have protocols and chec@@ kl@@ ists for how they handle everything   from bad weather to emer@@ gen@@ cies or in@@ oc@@ ul@@ ations for the cattle .
have proceeded 2700 lines.

Even the co@@ w@@ boys are pit cre@@ ws now .
And it seemed like time that we become that way ourselves .
Making systems work is the great task of my generation of physi@@ cians and scientists .
But I would go further and say that making systems work , whether in health care , education , climate change , making a path@@ way out of poverty , is the great task of our generation as a whole .
In every field , knowledge has explo@@ ded , but it has brought complexity , it has brought speci@@ alization .
And we &apos;ve come to a place where we have no choice but to recognize , as individu@@ alistic as we want to be , complexity requires group success .
We all need to be pit cre@@ ws now .
Thank you .
A@@ tu@@ l Ga@@ wan@@ de : How do we heal medicine ?
Our medical systems are broken . Doc@@ tors are capable of extraordinary treatments , but they are losing their core focus : actually treating people . Doctor and writer A@@ tu@@ l Ga@@ wan@@ de suggests we take a step back and look at new ways to do medicine  with fewer co@@ w@@ boys and more pit cre@@ ws .
What I &apos;d like you to do is , just really quickly , is just , sort of , no@@ d to the person on your right , and then no@@ d to the person on your left .
Now , chances are that over the last winter , if you had been a be@@ eh@@ ive , either you or one of the two people you just no@@ d@@ ded at would have died .
Now , that &apos;s an awful lot of bees .
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent of the col@@ onies , or we estimate we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the col@@ onies over the winter .
Now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
And most of those losses are because of things we know .
We know that there are these var@@ ro@@ a mit@@ es that have introduced and caused a lot of losses , and we also have this new phenomenon , which I talked about last year , Col@@ ony Coll@@ ap@@ se Dis@@ order .
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December .
And below , you can see all these out yards , or temporary yards , where the col@@ onies are brought in until February , and then they &apos;re shipped out to the al@@ mon@@ ds .
And one documentary writer , who was here and looked at this two months after I was here , described this not as be@@ eh@@ i@@ ves but as a gra@@ ve@@ yard , with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them .
Now , I &apos;m going to sum up a year &apos;s worth of work in two sentences to say that we have been trying to figure out what the cause of this is .
And what we know is that it &apos;s as if the bees have caught a flu .
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees .
In some cases , and in fact in most cases in one year , this flu was caused by a new virus to us , or newly identified by us , called Israeli A@@ cute Par@@ aly@@ sis virus .
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it , and he now regrets pro@@ found@@ ly calling it that disease , because , of course , there &apos;s the implic@@ ation .
But we think this virus is pretty u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous .
It &apos;s also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses or other fl@@ us , and so the question we &apos;re still struggling with , and the question that keeps us up at night , is why have the bees suddenly become so sus@@ cep@@ tible to this flu , and why are they so sus@@ cep@@ tible to these other diseases ?
And we don &apos;t have the answer to that yet , and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out .
We think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team that , you know , we &apos;re finding a lot of different pesticides in the hi@@ ve , and surpris@@ ingly , sometimes the heal@@ thi@@ est hi@@ ves have the most pesticides . And so we discover all these very strange things that we can &apos;t begin to understand .
And so this opens up the whole idea of looking at colony health .
Now of course , if you lose a lot of col@@ onies , be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers can replace them very quickly .
And that &apos;s why we &apos;ve been able to recover from a lot of loss .
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the National Guard would be out .
But what be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers can do is , if they have one survi@@ ving colony , they can split that colony in two .
And then the one half that doesn &apos;t have a queen , they can buy a queen .
It comes in the mail ; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida , and you can introduce that queen .
And in fact , America was the first country that ever did mail@@ @@ delivery que@@ ens and in fact , it &apos;s part of the postal code that you have to deliver que@@ ens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country .
If you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a thre@@ e@@ pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the Post@@ al Office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your thre@@ e@@ pound packages of bees .
And you can install this in your hi@@ ve and replace that dead@@ @@ out .
So it means that be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers are very good at replacing dead@@ @@ outs , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those losses .
So even though we &apos;ve lost 30 percent of the col@@ onies every year , the same number of col@@ onies have existed in the country , at about 2.4 million col@@ onies .
Now , those losses are tragic on many fron@@ ts , and one of those fron@@ ts is for the be@@ e@@ keeper .
And it &apos;s really important to talk about be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers first , because be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers are among the most fascinating people you &apos;ll ever meet .
If this was a group of be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers , you would have everyone from the car@@ d@@ carrying N@@ RA member who &apos;s , you know , live free or die , to the , you know , the self@@ expressed qu@@ ir@@ ky San Francisco back@@ yard pig farmer .
And you get all of these people in the same room , and they &apos;re all engaged and they &apos;re getting along , and they &apos;re all there because of the passion for bees .
Now , there &apos;s another part of that community which are the commercial be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers , the ones who make their li@@ vel@@ ihood from be@@ e@@ keeping alone .
And these tend to be some of the most independent , ten@@ ac@@ ious , intuitive , you know , in@@ ventive people you will ever meet .
They &apos;re just fascinating . And they &apos;re like that all over the world .
I had the privilege of working in Haiti just for two weeks earlier this year .
And Haiti , if you &apos;ve ever been there , is just a tragedy .
I mean , there may be 100 explanations for why Haiti is the im@@ po@@ ver@@ ished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squ@@ al@@ or .
But you meet this be@@ e@@ keeper , and I met this be@@ e@@ keeper here , and he is one of the most kno@@ wle@@ dge@@ able be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers I &apos;ve ever met .
No formal education , but very kno@@ wle@@ dge@@ able .
We needed be@@ es@@ wax for a project we were working on ; he was so capable , he was able to render the nic@@ est block of be@@ es@@ wax I have ever seen from cow dung , tin cans and his v@@ eil , which he used as a screening , right in this mea@@ dow . And so that in@@ genu@@ ity is inspir@@ ing .
We also have Dave H@@ acken@@ berg , who is the poster child of C@@ CD .
He &apos;s the one who first identified this condition and raised the alarm bells .
And he has a history of these trucks , and he &apos;s moved these bees up and down the coast .
And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees , and that being bad , but we &apos;ve done that for thousands of years .
The ancient Egyp@@ ti@@ ans used to move bees up and down the Ni@@ le on ra@@ fts , so this idea of a mov@@ able bee force is not new at all .
And one of our real worries with Col@@ ony Coll@@ ap@@ se Dis@@ order is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead@@ @@ out col@@ onies .
And you can do that one year in a row , you may be able to do it two years in a row .
But if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your col@@ onies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . And we &apos;re really worried about losing this segment of our industry .
And that &apos;s important for many fron@@ ts , and one of them is because of that culture that &apos;s in agriculture .
And these mig@@ rat@@ ory be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers are the last nom@@ ads of America .
You know , they pick up their hi@@ ves ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
And if you look at Florida , in D@@ ade City , Florida , that &apos;s where all the Pennsylvania be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers go .
And then 20 miles down the road is Gro@@ veland , and that &apos;s where all the Wis@@ cons@@ in be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers go .
And if you &apos;re ever in Central Valley in February , you go to this café at 10 o &apos;clock in the morning , Kathy and Kate &apos;s .
And that &apos;s where all the be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers come after a night of moving bees into the al@@ mond gro@@ ves .
They all have their breakfast and complain about everyone right there . And it &apos;s a great experience , and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time , because that &apos;s quite essential American experience .
And we see these families , these nom@@ adi@@ c families , you know , father to son , father to son , and these guys are hurting .
And they &apos;re not people who like to ask for help , although they are the most helpful people ever .
If there &apos;s one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck over@@ haul , everyone pit@@ ches in and gives 20 hi@@ ves to help him replace those lost col@@ onies .
And so , it &apos;s a very dynamic , and I think , historic and exciting community to be involved with .
Of course , the real importance for bees is not the honey .
And although I highly encourage you , all use honey .
I mean , it &apos;s the most ethical sweet@@ ener , and you know , it &apos;s a dynamic and fun sweet@@ ener .
But we estimate that about one in three bit@@ es of food we eat is directly or indirectly poll@@ inated by honey@@ bees .
Now , I want to just illustr@@ ate that in the fact that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning  a little cran@@ berry juice , some fruits , some gran@@ ola , I should have had whole wheat bread , I realized , but you know , jam on my Wonder@@ bread , and some coffee  and had we taken out all those ingredients ,  except for the al@@ mon@@ ds I wasn &apos;t going to pick out from the gran@@ ola  if we had taken out all those ingredients the bees had indirectly or directly poll@@ inated , we wouldn &apos;t have much on our plate .
So if we did not have bees , it &apos;s not like we would star@@ ve , but clearly our diet would be di@@ minis@@ hed .
It &apos;s said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the mess@@ engers of love .
And that &apos;s a really great expression , because really , bees are the sex workers for flowers . They are , you know  they get paid for their services .
They get paid by po@@ llen and nec@@ tar , to move that male sper@@ m , the po@@ llen , from flower to flower .
And there are flowers that are self@@ infer@@ tile . That means they can &apos;t  the po@@ llen in their blo@@ om can &apos;t fertili@@ ze themselves .
So in an apple or@@ chard , for instance , you &apos;ll have rows of 10 apples of one variety , and then you have another apple tree that &apos;s a different type of po@@ llen .
And bees are very faithful .
When they &apos;re out poll@@ inating or gathering po@@ llen from one flower , they stay to that crop exclusively , in order to help generate .
And of course , they &apos;re made to carry this po@@ llen .
They build up a static electric charge and the po@@ llen j@@ umps on them and helps spread that po@@ llen from blo@@ om to blo@@ om .
However , honey@@ bees are a minority .
Hon@@ ey@@ bees are not native to America ; they were introduced with the col@@ oni@@ alists .
And there are actually more species of bees than there are m@@ amm@@ als and birds combined .
In Pennsylvania alone , we have been surve@@ ying bees for 150 years , and very inten@@ sely in the last three years .
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania .
Thir@@ ty@@ @@ two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950 .
Now , that could be because we haven &apos;t been sampling right , but it does , I think , suggest that something &apos;s wrong with the poll@@ in@@ ator force . And these bees are fascinating .
We have bum@@ ble@@ bees on the top .
And bum@@ ble@@ bees are what we call e@@ us@@ o@@ cial : they &apos;re not truly social , because only the queen is , over winter .
We also have the sweat bees , and these are little gem@@ s flying around .

What these bees do is , they sit there . These so@@ lit@@ ary bees , they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch , and they collect po@@ llen and make it into a ball , and they lay an egg on it .
Well , these bees hang out at that hole , and they wait for that mother to fly away , they go in , eat the egg , and lay their own egg there . So they don &apos;t do any work .
And so , in fact , if you know you have these kle@@ p@@ top@@ ar@@ asi@@ tic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they &apos;re top@@ @@ of@@ @@ the@@ @@ food@@ @@ chain bees .
And in fact , there is now a red list of poll@@ in@@ ators that we &apos;re worried have disappeared , and on top of that list are a lot of these kle@@ p@@ top@@ ar@@ as@@ ites , but also these bum@@ ble@@ bees .
And in fact , if you guys live on the West Coast , go to these websites here , and they &apos;re really looking for people to look for some of these bum@@ ble@@ bees , because we think some have gone extin@@ ct . Or some , the population has dec@@ lined .
And so it &apos;s not just honey@@ bees that are in trouble , but we don &apos;t understand these native poll@@ in@@ ators or all those other parts of our community .
And of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
There are other animals that poll@@ inate , like b@@ ats , and b@@ ats are in trouble too .
And I &apos;m glad I &apos;m a bee man and not a bat man , because there &apos;s no money to research the bat problems .
And b@@ ats are dying at an extraordinary rate .
Whit@@ e@@ nose syn@@ drome has wiped out populations of b@@ ats .
If there &apos;s a cave in New York that had 15@@ ,000 b@@ ats in it , and there are 1,000 left . That &apos;s like San Francisco becoming the population of half of this county in three years .
And so that &apos;s incredible . And there &apos;s no money to do that .
But I &apos;m glad to say that I think we know the cause of all these conditions , and that cause is N@@ D@@ D : Nature De@@ fic@@ it Dis@@ order .
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is , we forgot our connection with nature .
And I think if we re@@ connect to nature , we &apos;ll be able to have the resources and that interest to solve these problems .
And I think that there is an easy cure for N@@ D@@ D .
And that is , make mea@@ dows and not la@@ wns .
And I think we have lost our connection , and this is a wonderful way of re@@ connecting to our environment .
I &apos;ve had the privilege of living by a mea@@ dow for the last little while , and it is terribly eng@@ aging .
And if we look at the history of la@@ wns , it &apos;s actually rather tragic .
It used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a lawn was a symbol of pres@@ tige , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , deser@@ ts : they &apos;re totally steri@@ le .
Americans spent , in 2001  11 percent of all pesti@@ cide use was done on la@@ wns .
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mo@@ wing our la@@ wns .
And so it &apos;s incredible the amount of resources we &apos;ve spent keeping our la@@ wns , which are these useless bio@@ systems .
And so we need to re@@ think this idea .
In fact , you know , the White House used to have sheep in front in order to help fund the war effort in World War I , which probably is not a bad idea ; it wouldn &apos;t be a bad idea .
I want to say this not because I &apos;m opposed completely to mo@@ wing la@@ wns .
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping la@@ wns at a limited scale , and I think we &apos;re encouraged to do that .
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a mea@@ dow or living by a mea@@ dow is transform@@ ational .
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what &apos;s there .
These mil@@ k@@ weed plants have grown up in my mea@@ dow over the last four years . Add to watch the different plants , or in@@ sects , that come to these flowers , to watch that  and we &apos;ve heard about , you know , this relationship you can have with wine , this companion you can have as it mat@@ ures and as it has these different fra@@ gran@@ ces .
And this is a companion , and this is a relationship that never dri@@ es up .
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine , too .
And I encourage you to look at that .
Now , not all of us have mea@@ dows , or la@@ wns that we can convert , and so you can always , of course , grow a mea@@ dow in a pot .
Be@@ es apparently , can be the g@@ ateway to , you know , other things .
So I &apos;m not saying that you should plant a mea@@ dow of pot , but a pot in a mea@@ dow .
But you can also have this great community of city or buil@@ ding@@ @@ top be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers , these be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers that live  This is in Paris where these be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers live .
And everyone should open a be@@ eh@@ ive , because it is the most amazing , incredible thing .
And if we want to cure ourselves of N@@ D@@ D , or Nature De@@ fic@@ it Dis@@ order , I think this is a great way of doing it .
Get a be@@ eh@@ ive and grow a mea@@ dow , and watch that life come back into your life .
And so with that , I think that what we can do , if we do this , we can make sure that our future  our more perfect future  includes be@@ e@@ ke@@ epers and it includes bees and it includes those mea@@ dows .
And that journey  that journey of transformation that occurs as you grow your mea@@ dow and as you keep your bees or you watch those native bees there  is an extremely exciting one .
And I hope that you experience it and I hope you tell me about it one day .
So thank you very much for being here . Thank you very much .

That was wh@@ ist@@ ling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
What is a ch@@ ub@@ by , cur@@ ly@@ @@ ha@@ ired guy from Holland  why is he wh@@ ist@@ ling ?
Well actually , I &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; wh@@ ist@@ ling since the age of four , about four .
My dad was always wh@@ ist@@ ling around the house , and I just thought that &apos;s part of communication in my family .
So I wh@@ ist@@ led along with him .
And actually , till I was 34 , I always anno@@ yed and irrit@@ ated people with wh@@ ist@@ ling , because , to be honest , my wh@@ ist@@ ling is a kind of devi@@ ant behavior .
I wh@@ ist@@ led alone . I wh@@ ist@@ led in the class@@ room .
I wh@@ ist@@ led on &#91; my &#93; bike . I wh@@ ist@@ led everywhere .
And I also wh@@ ist@@ led at a Christmas Eve party with my fam@@ il@@ y@@ in@@ @@ law .
And they had some , in my opinion , terrible Christmas music .
And when I hear music that I don &apos;t like , I try to make it better .
So &quot; Ru@@ dol@@ ph the Red@@ @@ No@@ sed Rein@@ deer &quot;  you know it ?
But it can also sound like this .
But during a Christmas party  at dinner actually  it &apos;s very annoying .
So my s@@ is@@ ter@@ @@ in@@ @@ law asked me a few times , &quot; Please stop wh@@ ist@@ ling . &quot;
And I just couldn &apos;t .
And at one point  and I had some wine , I have to admit that  at one point I said , &quot; If there was a contest , I would join . &quot;
And two weeks later I received a text message : &quot; You &apos;re going to America . &quot;
So , okay , I &apos;m going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
So I immediately called her up , of course .
She Goo@@ gled , and she found this World Wh@@ ist@@ ling Championship in America , of course .
She didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
And I would have lost my face .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s correct English .
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean .
I lost my face .
And she thought , &quot; He will never go there . &quot;
But actually I did .
So I went to Lou@@ is@@ burg , North Carolina , sou@@ theast United States , and I entered the world of wh@@ ist@@ ling .
And I also entered the world championship , and I won there in 2004 .
That was great fun , of course .
And to defend my title  like ju@@ do@@ kas do and spor@@ ts@@ men  I thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and I won again .
Then I couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
And in 2008 I entered again in Japan , Tokyo , and I won again .
So what happened now is I &apos;m standing here in Rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and I &apos;m talking about wh@@ ist@@ ling .
And actually I earn my money wh@@ ist@@ ling at the moment .
So I quit my day job as a nurse .
And I try to live my dream  well , actually , it was never my dream , but it sounds so good .
Okay , I &apos;m not the only one wh@@ ist@@ ling here .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
Well actually , you are going to whistle along .
And then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , &quot; Oh , my God .
Why ? Can I go away ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .

The track that I will whistle is called &quot; F@@ ê@@ te de la Belle . &quot;
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
No , no , no . It &apos;s four minutes long .
And I want to first rehear@@ se with you your wh@@ ist@@ ling .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of t@@ ones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
I &apos;ll ask the techni@@ cians to start the music .

Max Wes@@ ter@@ man : Ge@@ ert Cha@@ tro@@ u , the World Champion &#91; of &#93; Wh@@ ist@@ ling .
Ge@@ ert Cha@@ tro@@ u : Thank you . Thank you .
Ge@@ ert Cha@@ tro@@ u : A wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer you haven &apos;t heard
In this eng@@ aging talk , world champion wh@@ ist@@ ler Ge@@ ert Cha@@ tro@@ u perform@@ s the whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal &quot; Ele@@ on@@ ora &quot; by A. Hon@@ hoff , and his own &quot; F@@ ê@@ te de la Belle . &quot; In a fascinating inter@@ lu@@ de , he talks about what brought him to the craft . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Sometimes I go brow@@ sing &#91; through &#93; a very old magazine .
I found this observation test about the story of the ark .
And the artist that drew this observation test did some errors , had some mistakes  there are more or less 12 mistakes .
Some of them are very easy .
There is a fun@@ nel , an a@@ erial part , a lamp and clo@@ ck@@ work key on the ark .
Some of them are about the animals , the number .
But there is a much more fundamental mistake in the overall story of the ark that &apos;s not reported here .
And this problem is : where are the plants ?
So now we have God that is going to sub@@ mer@@ ge Earth permanently or at least for a very long period , and no one is taking care of plants .
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird , of every kind of animal , of every kind of creature that moves , but no mention about plants .
Why ?
In another part of the same story , all the living creatures are just the living creatures that came out from the ark , so birds , livestock and wild animals .
Plan@@ ts are not living creatures  this is the point .
That is a point that is not coming out from the Bible , but it &apos;s something that really accompanied humanity .
Let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a Renaissance book .
Here we have the description of the order of nature .
It &apos;s a nice description because it &apos;s starting from left  you have the stones  immediately after the stones , the plants that are just able to live .
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense , and on the top of the py@@ ra@@ mid , there is the man .
This is not the common man .
The &quot; Hom@@ o stu@@ dio@@ sus &quot;  the studying man .
This is quite comfor@@ ting for people like me  I &apos;m a professor  this to be over there on the top of creation .
But it &apos;s something completely wrong .
You know very well about prof@@ essors .
But it &apos;s also wrong about plants , because plants are not just able to live ; they are able to sense .
They are much more sophisticated in sen@@ sing than animals .
Just to give you an example , every single root ap@@ ex is able to detect and to monitor conc@@ ur@@ rently and continuously at least 15 different chemical and physical parameters .
And they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
Well , but this is something  this under@@ estim@@ ation of plants is something that is always with us .
Let &apos;s have a look at this short movie now .
We have David At@@ ten@@ borough .
Now David At@@ ten@@ borough is really a plant lover ; he did some of the most beautiful movies about plant behavior .
Now , when he speaks about plants , everything is correct .
When he speaks about animals , &#91; he &#93; tends to remove the fact that plants exist .
The blue whale , the biggest creature that exists on the planet  that is wrong , completely wrong .
The blue whale , it &apos;s a d@@ warf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet  that is , this wonderful , magnificent Sequ@@ o@@ i@@ ad@@ end@@ ron gigan@@ te@@ um .
And this is a living organism that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons .
Now , the story that plants are some low@@ @@ level organisms has been form@@ alized many times ago by Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ le , that in &quot; De Anim@@ a &quot;  that is a very influ@@ ential book for the Western civilization  wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living .
They have just a kind of very low@@ @@ level soul .
It &apos;s called the veget@@ ative soul , because they lack movement , and so they don &apos;t need to sense .
Let &apos;s see .
Okay , some of the movements of the plants are very well@@ @@ known .
This is a very fast movement .
This is a Di@@ on@@ a@@ ea , a Venus fly trap hunting sn@@ ails  sorry for the s@@ nail .
This has been something that has been refused for centuries , despite the evidence .
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal , because it was against the order of nature .
But plants are also able to show a lot of movement .
Some of them are very well known , like the flo@@ wering .
It &apos;s just a question to use some techniques like the time lap@@ se .
Some of them are much more sophisticated .
Look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
And it &apos;s really so gra@@ ceful ; it &apos;s like a dancing angel .
They are also able to play  they are really playing .
These are young sun@@ flowers , and what they are doing cannot be described with any other terms than playing .
They are training themselves , as many young animals do , to the adult life where they will be called to track the sun all the day .
They are able to respond to gravity , of course , so the sho@@ ots are growing against the v@@ ector of gravity and the roots toward the v@@ ector of gravity .
But they are also able to sleep .
This is one , Mim@@ osa pu@@ di@@ ca .
So during the night , they cur@@ l the leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , you have the opening of the leaves  there is much more movement .
This is interesting because this sleeping machinery , it &apos;s perfectly con@@ served .
It &apos;s the same in plants , in in@@ sects and in animals .
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem , it &apos;s easy to study on plants , for example , than in animals and it &apos;s much more easy even eth@@ ically .
It &apos;s a kind of veget@@ arian experim@@ entation .
Plan@@ ts are even able to communicate  they are extraordinary communic@@ ators .
They communicate with other plants .
They are able to distinguish kin and non@@ kin .
They communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical vol@@ ati@@ les , for example , during the poll@@ ination .
Now with the poll@@ ination , it &apos;s a very serious issue for plants , because they move the po@@ llen from one flower to the other , yet they cannot move from one flower to the other .
So they need a v@@ ector  and this v@@ ector , it &apos;s normally an animal .
Many in@@ sects have been used by plants as v@@ ec@@ tors for the transport of the poll@@ ination , but not just in@@ sects ; even birds , rep@@ tiles , and m@@ amm@@ als like b@@ ats rats are normally used for the transportation of the po@@ llen .
This is a serious business .
We have the plants that are giving to the animals a kind of sweet substance  very energi@@ zing  having in change this transportation of the po@@ llen .
But some plants are manipul@@ ating animals , like in the case of or@@ chi@@ ds that promise sex and nec@@ tar and give in change nothing for the transportation of the po@@ llen .
Now , there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen .
How is it possible to do this without a brain ?
We need to wait until 18@@ 80 , when this big man , Charles Darwin , publis@@ hes a wonderful , aston@@ ishing book that starts a revolution .
The title is &quot; The Power of Mo@@ vement in Plan@@ ts . &quot;

No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants before Charles Darwin .
In his book , assisted by his son , Francis  who was the first professor of plant physi@@ ology in the world , in Cambridge  they took into consideration every single movement for 500 pages .
And in the last paragraph of the book , it &apos;s a kind of sty@@ lis@@ tic mark , because normally Charles Darwin stored , in the last paragraph of a book , the most important message .
He wrote that , &quot; It &apos;s hardly an exagger@@ ation to say that the tip of the radical acts like the brain of one of the lower animals . &quot;
This is not a metap@@ hor .
He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends who was J.@@ D. Hoo@@ ker , or at that time , president of the Royal Society , so the maximum scientific authority in Britain speaking about the brain in the plants .
Now , this is a root ap@@ ex growing against a slo@@ pe .
So you can recognize this kind of movement , the same movement that wor@@ ms , sn@@ akes and every animal that are moving on the ground without legs is able to display .
And it &apos;s not an easy movement because , to have this kind of movement , you need to move different regions of the root and to synchron@@ ize these different regions without having a brain .
So we studied the root ap@@ ex and we found that there is a specific region that is here , depic@@ ted in blue  that is called the &quot; transition zone . &quot;
And this region , it &apos;s a very small region  it &apos;s less than one milli@@ meter .
And in this small region you have the highest consumption of oxygen in the plants and more important , you have these kinds of signals here .
The signals that you are seeing here are action potential , are the same signals that the neur@@ ons of my brain , of our brain , use to exchange information .
Now we know that a root ap@@ ex has just a few hundred cells that show this kind of feature , but we know how big the root apparatus of a small plant , like a plant of r@@ ye .
We have almost 14 million roots .
We have 11 and a half million root ap@@ ex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
Now let &apos;s imagine that each single root ap@@ ex is working in network with all the others .
Here were have on the left , the Internet and on the right , the root apparatus .
They work in the same way .
They are a network of small comp@@ uting machines , working in networks .
And why are they so similar ?
Because they evolved for the same reason : to survive pre@@ dation .
They work in the same way .
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus and the plants &#91; continue &#93; to work .
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet and it is &#91; continuing &#93; to work .
So , a suggestion for the people working with networks : plants are able to give you good suggestions about how to evol@@ ve networks .
And another possibility is a technological possibility .
Let &apos;s imagine that we can build robots and robots that are inspired by plants .
Until now , the man was inspired just by man or the animals in producing a robot .
We have the anim@@ alo@@ id  and the normal robots inspired by animals , in@@ sec@@ to@@ id , so on .
We have the and@@ ro@@ ids that are inspired by man .
But why have we not any plan@@ to@@ id ?
Well , if you want to fly , it &apos;s good that you look at birds  to be inspired by birds .
But if you want to explore so@@ ils , or if you want to col@@ oni@@ ze new territory , to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants that are masters in doing this .
We have another possibility we are working &#91; on &#93; in our lab , &#91; which &#93; is to build hybri@@ ds .
It &apos;s much more easy to build hybri@@ ds .
Hybri@@ d means it &apos;s something that &apos;s half living and half machine .
It &apos;s much more easy to work with plants than with animals .
They have comp@@ uting power , they have electrical signals .
The connection with the machine is much more easy , much more even eth@@ ically possible .
And these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybri@@ ds , driven by al@@ ga@@ e or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
Well , thank you for your attention .
And before I finish , I would like to re@@ assure that no sn@@ ails were har@@ med in making this presentation .
Thank you .
Stef@@ ano Man@@ cus@@ o : The roots of plant intelligence

I started Im@@ pro@@ v Every@@ where about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy .
Because I was new to the city , I didn &apos;t have access to a stage , so I decided to create my own in public places .
So the first project we &apos;re going to take a look at is the very first No P@@ ants Sub@@ way Ri@@ de .
Now this took place in January of 2002 .
And this woman is the star of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being fil@@ med .
She &apos;s being fil@@ med with a hidden camera .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
And this is the first stop along the line .
These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera .
And that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
It &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scar@@ f .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
And as you &apos;ll see now , I &apos;m not wearing pants .
So at this point  at this point she &apos;s noticed me , but in New York there &apos;s weir@@ dos on any given train car .
One person &apos;s not that unusual .
She goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately ti@@ tled &quot; Rap@@ e . &quot;
So she &apos;s noticed the unusual thing , but she &apos;s gone back to her normal life .
Now in the meantime , I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consec@@ utive stops in their underwear as well .
They &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And we &apos;ll act as if it &apos;s just an unfortunate mistake we &apos;ve made , forgetting our pants on this cold January day .
So at this point , she decides to put the rape book away .
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings .
Now in the meantime , the two Danish guys to the left of the camera , they &apos;re cra@@ cking up .
They think this is the fun@@ ni@@ est thing they &apos;ve ever seen before .
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
And I love that moment in this video , because before it became a shared experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit scary , or something that was at least confusing to her .
And then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
So the video won &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four stops .
A total of seven guys enter anon@@ ym@@ ously in their underwear .
At the eigh@@ th stop , a girl came in with a giant du@@ ffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar  like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
We all very matter of fac@@ tly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; Thank you . That &apos;s exactly what I needed today , &quot; and then ex@@ ited without reve@@ aling what had happened and went in all different directions .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
And watching that vide@@ ot@@ ape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do .
And really one of the points of Im@@ pro@@ v Every@@ where is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people .
It &apos;s a p@@ rank , but it &apos;s a p@@ rank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No P@@ ants Sub@@ way Ri@@ de .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
This January , we did the 10th annual No P@@ ants Sub@@ way Ri@@ de where a diverse group of 3,@@ 500 people ro@@ de the train in their underwear in New York  almost every single train line in the city .
And also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
As I started taking impro@@ v class at the Up@@ right Citizens Brig@@ ade Theater and meeting other creative people and other perform@@ ers and com@@ edi@@ ans , I started am@@ ass@@ ing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
So I could do more lar@@ ge@@ @@ scale projects .
Well one day I was walking through Union Square , and I saw this building , which had just been built in 2005 .
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing .
And it was very peculiar , because it was dark out , but she was back@@ @@ lit with fl@@ or@@ es@@ cent lighting , and she was very much on@@ stage , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why she was doing it .
After about 15 seconds , her friend appeared  she had been hiding behind a display  and they laughed and hu@@ gged each other and ran away .
So it seemed like maybe she had been dar@@ ed to do this .
So I got inspired by that .
have proceeded 3100 lines.

Looking at the entire fac@@ ade  there were 70 total windows  and I knew what I had to do .
So this project is called Look Up More . We had 70 actors dress in black .
This was completely un@@ authorized .
We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four@@ @@ foot tall letters that sp@@ elled out &quot; Look Up More , &quot; the name of the project .
The second signal was for everybody to do J@@ ump@@ ing j@@ acks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
And then we had dancing . We had everyone dance .
And then we had dance sol@@ os where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
So then I gave a new hand signal , which sign@@ aled the next sol@@ o@@ ist down below in For@@ ever 21 , and he dan@@ ced .
There were several other activities .
We had people jumping up and down , people dropping to the ground .
And I was standing just anon@@ ym@@ ously in a swe@@ at@@ shirt , putting my hand on and off of a tras@@ h@@ can to signal the adv@@ anc@@ ement .
And because it was in Union Square Park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
There &apos;s a better photo of it .
So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stum@@ ble upon .
The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said , &quot; You should get as many people as possible to put on blue pol@@ o shirts and k@@ ha@@ ki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around . &quot;
So I wrote this high school kid back immediately , and I said , &quot; Yes , you are correct .
I think I &apos;ll try to do that this weekend . Thank you . &quot;
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
We had about 80 people show up to participate , entering on@@ e@@ by@@ @@ one .
There was an eight year@@ @@ old girl , a 10 year@@ @@ old girl .
There was also a 65 year@@ @@ old man who participated .
So a very diverse group of people .
And I told people , &quot; Don &apos;t work . Don &apos;t actually do work .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt .
Everybody else is one of our actors .
The lower level employees thought it was very funny .
And in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
The managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
You can see them in this footage .
They &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming , watch out , the cops were coming .
And you can see the cops in this footage right here .
That &apos;s a cop wearing black right there , being fil@@ med with a hidden camera .
Ul@@ ti@@ mately , the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue pol@@ o shirt and k@@ ha@@ ki pants .
So we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras .
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in du@@ ffel bags .
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pret@@ ended to shop .
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them .
I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
I had to make a transfer at the 5@@ 3rd St. stop where there are these two giant escal@@ ators .
And it &apos;s a very depres@@ sing place to be in the morning , it &apos;s very crowded .
So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning .
So this was in the winter of 2009  8 : 30 in the morning .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
People are coming in from Queens , transferring from the E train to the 6 train .
And they &apos;re going up these giant escal@@ ators on their way to their jobs .
Thank you .
So there &apos;s a photograph that illustr@@ ates it a little bit better .
He gave 2,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he washed his hands before and after@@ ward and did not get sick .
And that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
So I &apos;d say over the years , one of the most common critic@@ isms I see of Im@@ pro@@ v Every@@ where left anon@@ ym@@ ously on YouTube comments is : &quot; These people have too much time on their hands . &quot;
And you know , not everybody &apos;s going to like everything you do , and I &apos;ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments , but that one &apos;s always bothered me , because we don &apos;t have too much time on our hands .
The participants at Im@@ pro@@ v Every@@ where events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yor@@ kers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
You know , every Saturday and Sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football sta@@ di@@ ums to watch games .
And I &apos;ve never seen anybody comment , looking at a football game , saying , &quot; All those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . &quot;
And of course they don &apos;t .
It &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
But I think it &apos;s also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a gho@@ st@@ bu@@ ster and running through the New York Public Library .
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing sil@@ ently in a park , or bur@@ sting into song in a gro@@ cery store as part of a spontan@@ eous musical , or diving into the ocean in Con@@ ey Island wearing formal at@@ tire .
You know , as kids , we &apos;re taught to play .
And we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
And I think that &apos;s sort of the point of Im@@ pro@@ v Every@@ where .
It &apos;s that there is no point and that there doesn &apos;t have to be a point .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
As long as it &apos;s fun and it seems like it &apos;s going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that &apos;s enough for us .
And I think , as adults , we need to learn that there &apos;s no right or wrong way to play .
Thank you very much .
Charlie Todd : The shared experience of absur@@ dity

In his talk , he shows how his group , Im@@ pro@@ v Every@@ where , uses these scenes to bring people together . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Ch@@ oler@@ a was reported in Haiti for the first time in over 50 years last October .
There was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation would get .
And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
We &apos;ve gotten good at predic@@ ting and preparing for stor@@ ms before they take innocent lives and cause irre@@ ver@@ sible damage , but we still can &apos;t do that with water , and here &apos;s why .
Right now , if you want to test water in the field , you need a trained techni@@ cian , expensive equipment like this , and you have to wait about a day for chemical reactions to take place and provide results .
It &apos;s too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change , too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing .
And it ignor@@ es the fact that , in the mean@@ while , people still need to drink water .
Most of the information that we collected on the ch@@ oler@@ a outbreak didn &apos;t come from testing water ; it came from forms like this , which documented all the people we failed to help .
Coun@@ tless lives have been saved by can@@ aries in co@@ al@@ mines  a simple and inval@@ u@@ able way for min@@ ers to know whether they &apos;re safe .
I &apos;ve been inspired by that simp@@ licity as I &apos;ve been working on this problem with some of the most hard@@ working and brilliant people I &apos;ve ever known .
We think there &apos;s a simpler solution to this problem  one that can be used by people who face conditions like this everyday .
It &apos;s in its early stages , but this is what it looks like right now .
We call it the Water Canary .
It &apos;s a fast , cheap device that answers an important question : Is this water contaminated ?
It doesn &apos;t require any special training .
And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place , it uses light .
That means there &apos;s no waiting for chemical reactions to take place , no need to use reag@@ ents that can run out and no need to be an expert to get ac@@ tion@@ able information .

To test water , you simply insert a sample and , within seconds , it either displays a red light , indicating contaminated water , or a green light , indicating the sample is safe .
This will make it possible for anyone to collect life@@ @@ saving information and to monitor water quality conditions as they un@@ fold .
We &apos;re also , on top of that , integrating wireless networking into an affordable device with GPS and G@@ SM .
What that means is that each reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be ma@@ pped in real time .
With enough users , maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action , containing haz@@ ards before they turn into emer@@ gen@@ cies that take years to recover from .
And then , instead of taking days to dissem@@ inate this information to the people who need it most , it can happen automatically .
We &apos;ve seen how distributed networks , big data and information can transform society .
I think it &apos;s time for us to apply them to water .
Our goal over the next year is to get Water Canary ready for the field and to open@@ @@ source the hardware so that anyone can contribute to the development and the evaluation , so we can tackle this problem together .
Thank you .
Son@@ a@@ ar Lu@@ thr@@ a : Meet the Water Canary
After a crisis , how can we tell if water is safe to drink ? Cur@@ rent tests are slow and complex , and the delay can be deadly , as in the ch@@ oler@@ a outbreak after Haiti &apos;s earthquake in 2010 . Fel@@ low Son@@ a@@ ar Lu@@ thr@@ a pre@@ views his design for a simple tool that quickly tests water for safety  the Water Canary .
It &apos;s wonderful to be back .
I love this wonderful gathering .
And you must be wondering , &quot; What on Earth ?
Have they put up the wrong slide ? &quot;
No , no .
Look at this magnificent beast and ask the question  who designed it ?
This is TED .
This is Technology , Entertainment , Design and there &apos;s a dairy cow .
It &apos;s a quite wonder@@ fully designed animal .
And I was thinking , how do I introduce this ?
And I thought , well , maybe that old dog@@ ger@@ el by Joyce Kil@@ mer , you know : &quot; Po@@ ems are made by fools like me , but only God can make a tree . &quot;
And you might say , &quot; Well , God designed the cow . &quot;
But , of course , God got a lot of help .
This is the anc@@ est@@ or of cattle .
This is the Or@@ y@@ x .
And it was designed by natural selection , the process of natural selection , over many millions of years .
And then it became dom@@ es@@ ticated thousands of years ago .
And human beings became its ste@@ wards , and , without even knowing what they were doing , they gradually re@@ designed it and re@@ designed it and re@@ designed it .
And then , more recently , they really began to do sort of reverse engineering on this beast and figure out just what the parts were , how they worked and how they might be optimi@@ zed  how they might be made better .
Now why am I talking about cows ?
Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religi@@ ons .
Religi@@ ons are natural phenomena .
They &apos;re just as natural as cows .
They have evolved over mill@@ en@@ nia .
They have a biological base , just like the Or@@ y@@ x .
They have become dom@@ es@@ ticated , and human beings have been re@@ designing their religi@@ ons for thousands of years .
This is TED , and I want to talk about design .
Because what I &apos;ve been doing for the last four years , really since the first time you saw me  some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion , and in the last four years I &apos;ve been working just about non@@ stop on this topic .
And you might say it &apos;s about the reverse engineering of religi@@ ons .
Now that very idea , I think , strikes terror in many people , or anger , or anxiety of one sort or another .
And that is the spell that I want to break .
I want to say , no , religi@@ ons are an important natural phenomenon .
We should study them with the same intensity that we study all the other important natural phenomena , like global warming , as we heard so elo@@ qu@@ ently last night from Al G@@ ore .
Today &apos;s religi@@ ons are bri@@ lli@@ antly designed  bri@@ lli@@ antly designed .
They &apos;re immen@@ sely powerful social institutions and many of their features can be traced back to earlier features that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering .
And , as with the cow , there &apos;s a mixture of e@@ volu@@ tionary design , designed by natural selection itself , and intelligent design  more or less intelligent design  and re@@ designed by human beings who are trying to re@@ design their religi@@ ons .
You don &apos;t do book talks at TED , but I &apos;m going to have just one slide about my book , because there is one message in it which I think this group really needs to hear .
And I would be very interested to get your responses to this .
It &apos;s the one policy proposal that I make in the book , at this time when I claim not to know enough about religion to know what other policy proposals to make .
And it &apos;s one that echo@@ es remarks that you &apos;ve heard already today .
Here &apos;s my proposal .
I &apos;m going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it  education in world religi@@ ons , on world religi@@ ons , for all of our children in primary school , in high school , in public schools , in private schools and in home school@@ ing .
So what I &apos;m proposing is , just as we require reading , writing , ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic , American history , so we should have a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um on facts about all the religi@@ ons of the world  about their history , about their cre@@ eds , about their texts , their music , their symbol@@ isms , their pro@@ hibitions , their requirements .
And this should be presented fac@@ tually , straight@@ for@@ war@@ dly , with no particular spin , to all of the children in the country .
And as long as you teach them that , you can teach them anything else you like .
That , I think , is maximal tolerance for religious freedom .
As long as you inform your children about other religi@@ ons , then you may  and as early as you like and whatever you like  teach them whatever cre@@ ed you want them to learn .
But also let them know about other religi@@ ons .
Now why do I say that ?
Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship .
Inform@@ ed consent is the very bed@@ rock of our understanding of democracy .
Mis@@ informed consent is not worth it .
It &apos;s like a coin flip ; it doesn &apos;t count really .
Democracy depends on informed consent .
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults .
Now , children below the age of consent are a special case .
I &apos;m going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used  parents are ste@@ wards of their children .
They don &apos;t own them .
You can &apos;t own your children .
You have a responsibility to the world , to the state , to them , to take care of them right .
You may teach them whatever cre@@ ed you think is most important , but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed about all the other cre@@ eds in the world , too .
The reason I &apos;ve taken this time is I &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated to hear some of the reactions to this .
One re@@ viewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it &quot; totalit@@ arian . &quot;
It strikes me as practically liber@@ t@@ arian .
Is it totalit@@ arian to require reading , writing and ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic ?
I don &apos;t think so .
All I &apos;m saying is  facts . F@@ acts only .
No values , just facts about all the world &apos;s religi@@ ons .
Another re@@ viewer called it &quot; hil@@ arious . &quot;
Well , I &apos;m really bothered by the fact that anybody would think that was hil@@ arious .
It seems to me to be such a plau@@ sible , natural extension of the democratic principles we already have , that I &apos;m shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous .
I know many religi@@ ons are so anxious about preserving the pur@@ ity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignor@@ ant of other fai@@ ths .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s defen@@ sible , but I &apos;d really be pleased to get your answers on that  any reactions to that  later .
But now I &apos;m going to move on .
Back to the cow .
This picture , which I pulled off the web  the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture .
That &apos;s the ste@@ ward .
Co@@ ws couldn &apos;t live without human ste@@ wards  they &apos;re dom@@ es@@ ticated .
They &apos;re a sort of ec@@ to@@ sym@@ bi@@ ont .
They depend on us for their survival .
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep .
I &apos;m going to talk about sheep , too .
There &apos;s a lot of ser@@ endi@@ pit@@ ous convergence here .
How clever it was of sheep to acquire sh@@ ep@@ her@@ ds !
Think of what this got them .
They could outs@@ ource all their problems  protection from pre@@ dat@@ ors , food finding , health maintenance .
The only cost in most flo@@ cks is a loss of free mat@@ ing .
What a deal .

&quot; How clever of sheep ! &quot; you might say .
Except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the sheep &apos;s cle@@ vern@@ ess .
We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists  they &apos;re not very smart .
It wasn &apos;t the cle@@ vern@@ ess of the sheep at all .
They were clu@@ eless .
But it was a very clever move .
Whose clever move was it ?
It was a clever move of natural selection itself .
Francis Cri@@ ck , the co@@ dis@@ cover@@ er of the structure of DNA with Jim Watson , once jo@@ ked about what he called Or@@ gel &apos;s Second Rule .
Leslie Or@@ gel is still a molec@@ ular bi@@ ologist , brilliant guy , and Or@@ gel &apos;s Second Rule is : Evolution is cle@@ ver@@ er than you are .
Now , that is not Intel@@ ligent Design  not from Francis Cri@@ ck .
Evolution is cle@@ ver@@ er than you are .
If you understand Or@@ gel &apos;s Second Rule , then you understand why the Intel@@ ligent Design movement is basically a ho@@ ax .
The designs discovered by the process of natural selection are brilliant , un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably brilliant .
Again and again bi@@ ologists are fascin@@ ated with the bri@@ lli@@ ance of what &apos;s discovered .
But the process itself is without purpose , without fores@@ ight , without design .
When I was here four years ago , I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass .
And why was the ant doing it ?
Well , it &apos;s because its brain had been infected with a lan@@ c@@ et flu@@ ke that was  needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow in order to re@@ produce .
It was sort of a spo@@ o@@ ky story .
And I think some people may have mis@@ understood .
Lan@@ c@@ et flu@@ kes aren &apos;t smart .
I submit that the intelligence of a lan@@ c@@ et flu@@ ke is down there somewhere between pet@@ uni@@ a and car@@ rot .
They &apos;re not really bright . They don &apos;t have to be .
The lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a beneficiary .
The design is there in nature , but it &apos;s not in anybody &apos;s head .
It doesn &apos;t have to be .
That &apos;s the way evolution works .
The question  was dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ation good for sheep ?
It was great for their genetic fitness .
And here I want to remind you of a wonderful point that Paul Mac@@ C@@ ready made at TED three years ago .
Here &apos;s what he said .
10,000 years ago at the dawn of agriculture , human population , plus livestock and pets , was approximately a tent@@ h of one per cent of the ter@@ restri@@ al ver@@ te@@ bra@@ e land@@ mass .
That was just 10,000 years ago .
Yesterday , in biological terms .
What is it today ? Does anybody remember what he told us ?
98 percent .
That is what we have done on this planet .
Now , I talked to Paul afterwards .
I wanted to check to find out how he &apos;d calculated this , and get the sources and so forth .
And he gave me a paper that he had written on this .
There was a passage in it which he did not present here and I think it is so good I &apos;m going to read it to you .
&quot; Over billions of years on a unique sphere , chance has painted a thin covering of life : complex , impro@@ b@@ able , wonderful and fragile .
Suddenly , we humans , a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inher@@ ent in nature , have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power .
We now wi@@ eld the paint@@ brush . &quot;
We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of var@@ n@@ ish .
Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet .
And we &apos;re the ones that hold the paint@@ brush .
And how can we do that ?
The key to our dom@@ ination of the planet is culture , and the key to culture is religion .
Suppose Mar@@ tian scientists came to Earth .
They would be pu@@ zz@@ led by many things .
Anybody know what this is ?
I &apos;ll tell you what it is .
This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Gan@@ ges in 2001 , perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever , as seen from satellite photograph .
Here &apos;s a big crowd .
Here &apos;s another crowd in Mec@@ ca .
Mar@@ ti@@ ans would be amaz@@ ed by this .
They &apos;d want to know how it origin@@ ated , what it was for and how it perpet@@ u@@ ates itself .
Actually , I &apos;m going to pass over this .
The ant isn &apos;t alone .
There &apos;s all sorts of wonderful cases of species .
In that case , a paras@@ ite gets into a mouse and it needs to get into the belly of a cat .
And it turns the mouse into Mi@@ ghty M@@ ouse  it makes it fear@@ less , so it runs out in the open , where it &apos;ll be eaten by a cat .
True story .
In other words , we have these hi@@ jack@@ ers  you &apos;ve seen this slide before , from four years ago  a paras@@ ite that inf@@ ects the brain and in@@ duc@@ es even su@@ ici@@ dal behavior on behalf of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fitness .
Does that ever happen to us ?
Yes , it does  quite wonder@@ fully .
The Arabic word &quot; Islam &quot; means &quot; submission . &quot;
It means &quot; surrender of self@@ interest to the will of Allah . &quot;
But I &apos;m not just talking about Islam .
I &apos;m talking also about Christi@@ anity .
This is a par@@ chment music page that I found in a Paris book@@ stall 50 years ago .
And on it it says , in Latin : The word of God is the seed and the so@@ wer of the seed is Christ . &quot;
Same idea ! Well , not quite .
But in fact , Christians , too , glory in the fact that they have sur@@ rendered to God .
I &apos;ll give you a few quot@@ es .
&quot; The heart of worship is surrender .
Sur@@ rendered people obey God &apos;s words , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
Those words are by Rick Warren .
Those are from &quot; The Pur@@ pose Dri@@ ven Life . &quot;
And I want to turn now , briefly , to talk about that book , which I &apos;ve read .
You &apos;ve all got a copy .
You &apos;ve just heard the man .
And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book from the design stand@@ point , because I think it &apos;s actually a brilliant book .
First of all , the goal .
And you heard just now what the goal is .
It &apos;s to bring purpose to the lives of millions , and he has succeeded .
Is it a good goal ?
In itself , I &apos;m sure we all agree , it is a wonderful goal .
He &apos;s absolutely right .
There are lots of people out there who don &apos;t have purpose in their life , and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal .
I give him an A  on this .
Is the goal achieved ?
Yes .
30 million copies of this book .
Al G@@ ore , eat your heart out .
Just exactly what Al is trying to do , Rick is doing .
This is a fantastic achievement .
And , the means  how does he do it ?

It &apos;s a brilliant re@@ design of traditional religious themes  updating them , quietly dropping obsol@@ ete features , putting new inter@@ pret@@ ations on other features .
This is the evolution of religion that &apos;s been going on for thousands of years , and he &apos;s just the latest brilliant practi@@ tioner of it .
I don &apos;t have to tell you this .
You &apos;ve just heard the man .
Excellent in@@ sights into human psych@@ ology , wise advice on every page .
Moreover , he invites us to look under the hood .
I really appreciated that .
For instance , he has an app@@ endi@@ x where he explains his choice of translations of different Bible ver@@ ses .
The book is clear , vi@@ vid , accessible , beautifully form@@ at@@ ted .
Just enough re@@ petition .
That &apos;s really important .
Every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
Every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
With me , everybody  every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
Thank you .
And now we come to my problem .
Because I &apos;m absolutely sincere in my appreciation of all that I &apos;ve said about this book .
But I wish it were better .
I have some problems with the book .
And it would just be in@@ sincere of me not to address those problems .
I wish he could do this with a revision , a Mark 2 version of his book .
&quot; The truth will set you free &quot;  that &apos;s what it says in the Bible , and it &apos;s something that I want to live by , too .
My problem is , some of the bits in it I don &apos;t think are true .
Now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that &apos;s not my main complaint .
That &apos;s worth mentioning .
Here &apos;s a passage  it &apos;s very much what he said , anyway .
&quot; If there was no God we would all be accidents , the result of astronom@@ ical random chance in the Uni@@ verse .
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose or meaning or significance .
There would be no right or wrong and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth . &quot;
Now , I just do not believe that .
By the way , I find Homer Gro@@ ening &apos;s film presented a beautiful alternative to that very claim .
Yes , there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong .
We don &apos;t need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us .
But that is just a difference of opinion .
That &apos;s not what I &apos;m really worried about .
How about this  &quot; God designed this planet &apos;s environment just so we could live in it . &quot;
I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people take that sen@@ timent to mean that we don &apos;t have to do the sorts of things that Al G@@ ore is trying so hard to get us to do .
I &apos;m not happy with that sen@@ timent at all .
And then I find this  &quot; All the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core pro@@ position that the co@@ smo@@ s is especially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all fac@@ ets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact . &quot;
Well , that &apos;s Michael D@@ ent@@ on . He &apos;s a cre@@ ation@@ ist .
And here I think , &quot; Wait a minute . &quot;
I read this again .
I read it three or four times and I think , &quot; Is he really endor@@ sing intelligent design ?
Is he endor@@ sing cre@@ ation@@ ism here ? &quot;
And you can &apos;t tell .
So I &apos;m sort of thinking , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know if I want to get upset with this yet . &quot;
But then I read on and I read this : &quot; First , Noah had never seen rain , because prior to the flood God ir@@ rig@@ ated the earth from the ground up . &quot;
I wish that sentence weren &apos;t in there , because I think it is false .
And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet , after we &apos;ve just been hearing about the history of the planet over millions of years , dis@@ coura@@ ges people from scientific understanding .
Now , Rick Warren uses scientific terms and scientific fac@@ toi@@ ds and information in a very interesting way .
Here &apos;s one : &quot; God deliberately shaped and formed you to serve him in a way that makes your minis@@ try unique .
He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you . &quot;
I think that &apos;s false .
Now maybe we want to treat it as metap@@ hor@@ ical .
Here &apos;s another one  &quot; For instance , your brain can store 100 tri@@ lli@@ on facts .
Your mind can handle 15@@ ,000 decisions a second . &quot;
Well , it would be interesting to find the interpretation where I would accept that .
There might be some way of treating that as true .
&quot; An@@ thropo@@ log@@ ists have noted that worship is a universal urge , hard@@ wired by God into the very fi@@ ber of our being , an in@@ built need to connect with God . &quot;
Well , there &apos;s a sense which I agree with him , except I think it has an e@@ volu@@ tionary explanation .
And what I find deeply trou@@ bling in this book is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral , if you want to have meaning in your life , you have to be an Intel@@ ligent Designer  you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection .
And I think , on the contrary , that it is very important to solving the world &apos;s problems that we take e@@ volu@@ tionary biology seriously .
Whose truth are we going to listen to ?
Well , this from &quot; The Pur@@ pose Dri@@ ven Life &quot;  &quot; The Bible must become the authorit@@ ative standard for my life , the comp@@ ass I rely on for direction , the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions and the bench@@ mark I use for evalu@@ ating everything . &quot;
Well maybe , OK , but what &apos;s going to follow from this ?
And here &apos;s one that does concern me .
Remember I quoted him before with this line  &quot; Sur@@ rendered people obey God &apos;s word , even if it doesn &apos;t make sense . &quot;
And that &apos;s a problem .
&quot; Don &apos;t ever argue with the Devil .
He &apos;s better at arguing than you are , having had thousands of years to practice . &quot;
Now Rick Warren didn &apos;t inv@@ ent this clever move .
It &apos;s an old move .
It &apos;s a very clever adaptation of religi@@ ons .
It &apos;s a wild@@ card for dis@@ ar@@ ming any reasonable criticism .
&quot; You don &apos;t like my interpretation ?
You &apos;ve got a reasonable objection to it ?
Don &apos;t listen , don &apos;t listen !
That &apos;s the Devil speaking . &quot;
This dis@@ coura@@ ges the sort of reason@@ ing citizenship it seems to me that we want to have .
I &apos;ve got one more problem , then I &apos;m through .
And I &apos;d really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it .
&quot; In the Great Commission , Jesus said , &apos; Go to all people of all nations and make them my dis@@ ciples . Bapti@@ ze them in the name of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , and teach them to do everything I &apos;ve told you . &apos; &quot; The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world .
Now here we &apos;ve seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so .
Here &apos;s one , not as beautiful as the others .
It simply shows the religi@@ ons of the world .
And here &apos;s one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religi@@ ons .
Now do we really want to commit ourselves to eng@@ ul@@ fing all the other religi@@ ons when their holy books are telling them , &quot; Don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just Satan talking ! &quot;
It seems to me that that &apos;s a very problematic ship to get on for the future .
I found this sign as I was driving to Ma@@ ine recently , in front of a church  &quot; Good without God becomes zero . &quot;
Sort of cute .
A very clever little me@@ me .
I don &apos;t believe it and I think this idea , popular as it is  not in this gu@@ ise but in general  is itself one of the main problems that we face .
If you are like me , you know many wonderful , committed , engaged ath@@ ei@@ sts , agno@@ sti@@ cs , who are being very good without God .
And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanc@@ ti@@ ty instead of doing good works .
So , I wish we could drop this me@@ me .
I wish this me@@ me would go extin@@ ct .
Thanks very much for your attention .
Dan D@@ enn@@ ett : Let &apos;s teach religion  all religion  in schools
Philosop@@ her Dan D@@ enn@@ ett calls for religion  all religion  to be taught in schools , so we can understand its nature as a natural phenomenon . Then he takes on The Pur@@ pos@@ e@@ Dri@@ ven Life , disp@@ uting its claim that , to be moral , one must deny evolution .
The Hin@@ dus say , &quot; N@@ ada bra@@ h@@ ma , &quot; one translation of which is , &quot; The world is sound . &quot;

And in a way , that &apos;s true , because everything is vibr@@ ating .
In fact , all of you as you sit here right now are vibr@@ ating .
Every part of your body is vibr@@ ating at different frequencies .
So you are , in fact , a ch@@ ord  each of you an individual ch@@ ord .
One definition of health may be that that ch@@ ord is in complete harmony .
Your ears can &apos;t hear that ch@@ ord ; they can actually hear amazing things . Your ears can hear 10 oc@@ ta@@ ves .
In@@ ci@@ dentally , we see just one oc@@ ta@@ ve .
Your ears are always on  you have no ear li@@ ds .
They work even when you sleep .
The smallest sound you can perc@@ eive moves your ear@@ drum just four atomic diam@@ eters .
The lou@@ dest sound you can hear is a tri@@ lli@@ on times more powerful than that .
E@@ ars are made not for hearing , but for listening .
Lis@@ ten@@ ing is an active skill , whereas hearing is passive , listening is something that we have to work at  it &apos;s a relationship with sound .
And yet it &apos;s a skill that none of us are taught .
For example , have you ever considered that there are listening positions , places you can listen from ?
Here are two of them .
Re@@ duc@@ tive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
It reduces everything down to what &apos;s relevant and it dis@@ cards everything that &apos;s not relevant .
Men typically listen reduc@@ tively .
So he &apos;s saying , &quot; I &apos;ve got this problem . &quot;
He &apos;s saying , &quot; Here &apos;s your solution . Thanks very much . Next . &quot;
That &apos;s the way we talk , right guys ?
Expan@@ sive listening , on the other hand , is listening &quot; with , &quot; not listening &quot; for . &quot;
It &apos;s got no destination in mind  it &apos;s just enjoying the journey .
Women typically listen expan@@ sively .
If you look at these two , eye contact , facing each other , possibly both talking at the same time .
Men , if you get nothing else out of this talk , practice expan@@ sive listening , and you can transform your relationships .
The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear is noise , surrounding us all the time .
No@@ ise like this , according to the European Union , is reducing the health and the quality of life of 25 percent of the population of Europe .
Two percent of the population of Europe  that &apos;s 16 million people  are having their sleep devast@@ ated by noise like that .
No@@ ise kills 200@@ ,000 people a year in Europe .
It &apos;s a really big problem .
Now , when you were little , if you had noise and you didn &apos;t want to hear it , you &apos;d stick your fingers in your ears and h@@ um .
These days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cooler .
It looks a bit like this .
The trouble with widespread head@@ phone use is it brings three really big health issues .
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schaf@@ er co@@ ined : &quot; schi@@ zop@@ hon@@ ia . &quot;
It &apos;s a dis@@ location between what you see and what you hear .
So , we &apos;re inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
I think there &apos;s something deeply un@@ healthy about living all the time in schi@@ zop@@ hon@@ ia .
The second problem that comes with head@@ phone abuse is comp@@ ression .
We squ@@ ash music to fit it into our pocket and there is a cost attached to this .
Listen to this  this is an un@@ comp@@ ressed piece of music .
And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed .
I do hope that some of you at least can hear the difference between those two .
There is a cost of comp@@ ression .
It makes you tired and irrit@@ able to have to make up all of that data .
You &apos;re having to imagine it .
It &apos;s not good for you in the long run .
The third problem with head@@ phones is this : de@@ af@@ ness  no@@ is@@ e@@ in@@ duced hearing disorder .
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another , but really wor@@ ry@@ ingly , 16 percent  roughly one in six  of American teen@@ agers suffer from no@@ is@@ e@@ in@@ duced hearing disorder as a result of head@@ phone abuse .
One study at an American university found that 61 percent of college fresh@@ men had damaged hearing as a result of head@@ phone abuse .
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people .
Now that &apos;s a really serious problem .
I &apos;ll give you three quick tips to protect your ears and pass these on to your children , please .
Professional hearing prot@@ ec@@ tors are great ; I use some all the time .
If you &apos;re going to use head@@ phones , buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don &apos;t have to have it so loud .
If you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud .
And thir@@ dly , if you &apos;re in bad sound , it &apos;s fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it .
Prot@@ ect your ears in that way .
Let &apos;s move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out .
WW@@ B : Wind , water , birds  sto@@ ch@@ as@@ tic natural sounds composed of lots of individual random events , all of it very healthy , all of it sound that we evolved to over the years .
Se@@ ek those sounds out ; they &apos;re good for you and so it this .
Silence is beautiful .
The Eliz@@ abe@@ th@@ ans described language as decorated silence .
I urge you to move away from silence with intention and to design sound@@ scap@@ es just like works of art .
Have a fore@@ ground , a background , all in beautiful proportion .
It &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
If you can &apos;t do it yourself , get a professional to do it for you .
Sound design is the future , and I think it &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to change the way the world sounds .
I &apos;m going to just run quickly through eight mod@@ alities , eight ways sound can improve health .
First , ul@@ tras@@ ound : we &apos;re very familiar with it from physical therapy ; it &apos;s also now being used to treat cancer .
Li@@ th@@ ot@@ ri@@ p@@ sy  saving thousands of people a year from the scal@@ pel by pul@@ veri@@ zing stones with high@@ @@ intensity sound .
Sound healing is a wonderful mod@@ ality .
It &apos;s been around for thousands of years .
I do urge you to explore this .
There are great things being done there , treating now au@@ tism , de@@ men@@ tia and other conditions .
And music , of course . Just listening to music is good for you , if it &apos;s music that &apos;s made with good intention , made with love , generally .
De@@ vo@@ tional music , good  Mozart , good .
There are all sorts of types of music that are very healthy .
And four mod@@ alities where you need to take some action and get involved .
First of all , listen consci@@ ously .
I hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .
It &apos;s a whole new dimension to your life and it &apos;s wonderful to have that dimension .
Secondly , get in touch with making some sound  create sound .
The voice is the instrument we all play , and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice ? Get trained ; learn to sing , learn to play an instrument .
Musi@@ cians have bigger brains  it &apos;s true .
You can do this in groups as well .
It &apos;s a fantastic anti@@ dote to schi@@ zop@@ hon@@ ia ; to make music and sound in a group of people , wh@@ ich@@ ever style you enjoy particularly .
And let &apos;s take a ste@@ warding role for the sound around us .
Prot@@ ect your ears ? Yes , absolutely .
Design sound@@ scap@@ es to be beautiful around you at home and at work .
And let &apos;s start to speak up when people are as@@ sailing us with the noise that I played you early on .
So I &apos;m going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound .
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful and if we all start doing these things , we will take a very big step in that direction .
So I urge you to take that path .
I &apos;m leaving you with a little more bir@@ d@@ song , which is very good for you .
I wish you sound health .
